REMINISCENCES<br />
OF THE LATE<br />
PRINCE TALLEYRAND.</span>
</h2>
</div>

<span class="subhead">THE DUC D’AIGUILLON AND MADAME DUBARRI—TALLEYRAND’S
RETURN FROM AMERICA—CHÉNIER,
MADAME DE STAËL, AND MADAME DE LA
BOUCHARDIE.</span></h2>

<p>“You have begun, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">malgré vous</i>,” said I to C., the
next time we met <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>, “the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vie anecdotique</i>
of the prince, which I have always felt sure would
prove so full of interest. Your strange story of
Madame de la Motte is quite sufficient to excite
curiosity in those who love to see the <em>truth</em> established
where prejudice and falsehood have reigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
so long. It would be a curious study to follow in
the same manner, step by step, the life of the Prince
de Talleyrand, and give to those who seek for <em>truth
alone</em> (and they are many) the real impressions
made upon a powerful organization, like his own,
by the wondrous changes in which he bore so conspicuous
a part; the conduct of those with whom
he co-operated in the great reform which, from the
very outset of his career, it is evident he had at
heart; and his own conduct with regard to the confederates
with whom the strange circumstances amid
which he found himself compelled him to associate
sometimes, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">malgré lui et à son corps defendant</i>.’”</p>

<p>“It would be difficult,” replied C., “to destroy
prejudices which have taken root. Mankind in
general cling to them with tenacity, and adopt
ready-formed opinions with the greatest facility in
proportion as they are improbable and absurd.
The Prince de Talleyrand has been the victim of
many such errors. From the great reserve, partly
natural to his character, and no doubt strengthened
by his clerical education, the motives by which he
was guided, unexplained by himself, have been left
to the interpretation of the mass; and the mass will
ever be loth to yield conviction save to the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
of facts alone. One of the most extraordinary
delusions which exist in the public mind with
regard to the prince, founded I should think upon
no better authority than a brutal attempt at wit made
by Napoleon, has been often adopted as a basis
for the judgment of his character. ‘Kick Talleyrand
behind,’ said the coarse-minded <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sabreur</i>, ‘and
look in his face, you will perceive no indication of
any sense of the insult.’ The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dictum</i>, which was
first uttered by the chattering buffoon of a Parisian
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, has been gravely quoted by more than one
historian, and has in many cases gone forth as the
standard whereby to judge one of the proudest characters
that the Almighty ever sent among mankind!</p>

<p>“Again—how often has he been accused of participating
in the murder of the Duc d’Enghien:
though his whole life disproves the accusation.
What single action of his long career can justify
this supposition? His aversion to bloodshed—his
avoidance of all violent measures—his forgiving
temper, which was constitutional—all tend to combat
the suspicion; and yet it has been greedily
received, not only by his enemies, but even by the
writers least interested in the affair—those of foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
nations, strangers to party-spirit in French politics,
and who may be supposed to be mere spectators of
the struggle. I think M. de Talleyrand owes this
unjust and offensive accusation entirely to the reserve
he has always maintained with regard to this
event. Had he been more explicit, had he ‘<em>spoken
out</em>,’ in short, upon the subject, his vilest detractors
would not have dared to affix this stain upon his
name, while the panegyrists of his great contemporary
would have hesitated before the <em>proofs</em> which
M. de Talleyrand can still produce. Although he
even yet mentions with caution all the circumstances
connected with this affair, which he himself
calls ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déplorable</i>,’ yet I have gathered enough to
make the recital interesting to you, and in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tems et
lieu</i> I will put you in possession of the facts; but
as you wish me to proceed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par ordre de date</i>, they
will find no place here. Accusation and defiance
are contrary to the whole system of conduct of the
prince. His forbearance towards his enemies
would sometimes excite the indignation of Mirabeau,
whose fiery soul gloried in attack, and scorned
defeat, from which he rose with fresh venom and
fresh vigour.</p>

<p>“‘One thing is needed to complete the character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of Talleyrand,’ said the giant, in despair at the
mildness of the prince, ‘he needs unjust imprisonment!’
The secret of the whole existence of Mirabeau—of
his success—his energy and defiance,
may perhaps be found in this simple exclamation.
Mirabeau might accuse Talleyrand of coldness and
over caution; but it was left for the coarse mind of
Napoleon to tax him with baseness and want of
self-respect. Now I, who have lived in the intimacy
of the prince for many years, and have been
in the habit of observing the impression produced
upon his temper by outward events, have arrived
at the conviction, that it is the very excess of pride,
of which Napoleon denied him the slightest portion,
that destroys the otherwise perfect equilibrium
of his character. I am a believer in the influence
of <em>race</em>, and can respect the philosophy which tells
us that the qualities of the soul are handed down
through long generations as well as the features of
the body. The proud motto of the sovereign counts
of Perigord, adopted in the sixth century, was borne
with justice by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand,
their descendant: <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ré que Diou!</i> In the old Perigord
language, ‘<span class="smcap">No King but God!</span>’</p>

<p>“Would not the simple utterance of this haughty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
device form an argument against the accusation of
‘versatility of opinion,’ of ‘change of masters’?
The parallel might be carried further still, down to
the famous Cardinal de Perigord, friend and confidant
of Petrarch, he who is called in Italian history
the pope-maker, who in the twelfth century
was the nominator of four different pontiffs, and
then dethroned the Emperor Louis V. to crown in
his stead Charles IV. He, too, was the most able
diplomatist of his time, and was deputed to London
to negotiate the ransom of the French King John.
He succeeded in reducing the ransom, and in obtaining
a truce, by the influence of his ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">langue
mielleuse et dorée</i>,’ as says the quaint old chronicler
of the time.</p>

<p>“Henri de Chalais might have saved his life
had he but spoken the one word of supplication to
his master. ‘The king has said that he will pardon
you if you will but sue,’ said his good old confessor
the night before his execution. ‘What prevents
you, then, Monseigneur, from asking?’</p>

<p>“‘The blood of the Talleyrands!’ said the
prince, and, turning to the wall, spoke no more
that night.</p>

<p>“You see they have ever been a taciturn and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
haughty race, faithful to the battle-cry of their
fierce forefathers. ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ré que Diou</i>’ must have been
graven on their hearts, as well as painted on their
banner. Did it never occur to the hard mind of
the emperor, that Talleyrand might be insensible to
insult from <em>contempt</em> of the aggressor? But come,
I am wasting time in theory, and you, I am well
aware, prefer facts and example.</p>

<p>“The political career of Prince Talleyrand may
be said to have begun at his very entrance into
life. I have given you a sketch of his childhood—to
detail the events of his youth would be to give
the history of the close of the eighteenth century.
I have heard him say often that few men could
boast of having passed through life as he had
done—always in a crowd, having to elbow his way
through the thickest ranks. During those early
years he cannot remember to have enjoyed or experienced
a single week’s solitude. Always in a
crowd, and that crowd composed of all that was
celebrated at the time, for wit, fashion, and beauty,
by his own merit he was continually in advance,
and, long before the age when other men enter the
lists, he had already travelled far on the road to
fame and fortune. It is this circumstance which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
makes his age for ever a subject of dispute. His
name has been so long before the public eye, in
connexion with those of individuals who had begun
their career so many years before him, that it
seems as if he himself belonged to another epoch
than our own. At the age of twenty-six, when he
was named <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agent-général</i> of the clergy, he had
already acquired the conviction that the society
amid which he was born was tottering to its basis,
and, moreover, that it was unworthy of an effort to
save it from destruction. I remember being much
amused by his description of the very first visit he
paid after being invested by his uncle with the title
and power of his new office, which, at the time,
was one of great trust and influence, and one which
demanded great industry and talent.</p>

<p>“He was one day <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en confidence</i> with me, and
mentioning several events of the last century.
‘How has that poor <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siècle</i> been calumniated,’ said
he, gaily, ‘and yet, after all, I do not see that the
<em>productive</em> power of your system equals that of the
one you so much condemn. Where is the wit of
your <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i>, the independence of your writers, the
charm and influence of your women? What have
you received in exchange for all these, which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
fled for ever? Were I young, I should regret, and
wish that I were old, to enjoy, at least in memory,
the delicious <em>existence morale</em> of <em>my</em> time. I would
not give the remembrance of those times for all the
novelty and what you call <em>improvements</em> of the
social system of to-day, even with the youth and
spirit necessary to enjoyment. ’Tis true there
were abuse and exaggeration in many of our institutions,
but where is the system in which these do
not exist? If our people was devoured with misery
and taxes, yours is wasting to the core with <em>envy</em>
and with discontent. Our <em>noblesse</em> was corrupt
and prodigal, yours is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoise</i> and miserly—greater
evils still for the prosperity of the nation.
If our king had many mistresses, yours has many
masters. Has <em>he</em> gained by the exchange? Thus
you see it clearly demonstrated that not one of the
three orders has advanced in happiness by these
wonderful <em>improvements</em> which you so much admire.’</p>

<p>“He joined good-naturedly in the laugh which
I could not repress at his last regret, and I asked
him if he had ever seen the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dernière maîtresse en
titre du Roi de France</i>, Madame Dubarri.</p>

<p>“‘Frequently,’ replied he, ‘both before and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
after her disgrace, and, moreover, the last visit I
ever paid her has been impressed upon my memory,
by the circumstance of its being the first I made
after having obtained the dignity of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agent-général
du clergé</i>, which my mother had been soliciting
for me so long. I had been the whole morning
closeted with my uncle, listening to his various instructions
and counsels relative to my new duties.
So anxious was the dear good man to make me
perfectly aware of the new dignity with which I had
just been invested, that he had kept me for more
than two hours standing before him. So strict was
the clerical etiquette of the time, that he dared not
request me to be seated in the presence of the two
acolytes, who, by the law of that same etiquette,
never left him, night or day, save when he himself
was admitted into the presence of a superior.</p>

<p>“‘As you may imagine, both my strength and
patience were exhausted before my dear uncle’s
allocution was over, and most heartily did I rejoice
when he stretched forth his hand for me to kiss, in
token of dismissal. He told me that he had much
more to say (I shivered), but that he was anxious
I should pay my respects to the minister that very
day, as the neglect of such attention might bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
disgrace and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">défaveur</i> at the very outset of my
career. I had just time sufficient to gain the minister’s
hôtel before the closing of his cabinet, so
made all speed to quit my uncle’s presence, glad
to escape even with the prospect of another
lecture.</p>

<p>“‘I was just descending the steps of the hôtel,
when I met the young Duc d’Aiguillon, all excited
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ébouriffé</i> as usual, with his vest wide open,
and his garments in disorder.</p>

<p>“‘Where are you going so fast?’ exclaimed he,
seizing my arm.</p>

<p>“‘To call upon the minister, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ministre</i>,’
said I, laughing at the look of surprise with which
he eyed me, and which betrayed plainly the troubled
state of his intellect.</p>

<p>“‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Parbleu!</i>’ exclaimed he, with the twinkling
of the eye peculiar to persons in the same state of
blessedness in which he then was, ‘and so am I
going to call upon the minister. My coach is
waiting at the corner, let us go together.’</p>

<p>“‘To this proposal I could of course offer no
objection, being, as I tell you, horribly fatigued
with my long <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">séance</i>, and having at that time no
carriage of my own at command. We walked to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the end of the street arm-in-arm together. He
leaned upon me heavily, but was laughing heartily
the whole way, as if inspired by some merry
thought.</p>

<p>“‘You see me thus delighted,’ said he, suddenly
stopping short, ‘at the remembrance of the glorious
fun we have just been having at the Trois Marroniers.
Why were you not there? We were but
three, but diverted ourselves <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comme quarante</i>.
Liancourt was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en verve</i>, and told some of his best
anecdotes about—(he hiccupped slightly)—about
Madame Dubarri! I should like to see that
woman. Did you ever see her?’ He nodded
assent in answer to his own question, and then, with
a tipsy giggle, he pushed me in the side, exclaiming,
‘Well, then, jump into the carriage, and I will
tell you all about her as we drive along to the
minister’s.’</p>

<p>“‘He spoke some few words to his lackey, and
seated himself beside me. The moment he entered,
he drew down the blinds of the carriage, and, far
from opposing such a measure, I was enchanted at
what, in my own mind, I termed his discretion, as
I thought that he was beginning to be aware of the
state he was in, and was afraid of making himself
the public gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
“‘The duke was one of the most witty men I
ever met with. It would be difficult to find a more
piquant narrator than himself; and upon this occasion,
the little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pointe de vin</i> which he had taken
had awakened his imagination, and caused him to
be even more lively and amusing than usual. His
gaiety was contagious; and as he told one after
the other the most <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">échevelé</i> anecdotes of the ex-favourite,
all of the kind most likely to have been
served up by M. de Liancourt for the entertainment
of his dissolute companions, the peals of
laughter which his recitals caused me to emit,
rivalled his own in noise and duration. So absorbed
was I in listening to his merry stories, and
so diverted by his pleasant manner of telling them,
that I did not perceive the tremendous rate at which
the horses were going, nor the length of time which
seemed to have been occupied in our short journey
to the hôtel of the minister.</p>

<p>“‘Once, indeed, d’Aiguillon had stopped in the
midst of one of his best narrations to draw aside
the blind, exclaiming, ‘What, shall we never reach
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ce diable de ministre</i>?’ and, after looking out, had
thrown himself back with another of those comical
laughs, in which I could not help joining with all
my heart; but I was so much amused, and felt myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
so extremely happy, that no suspicion entered
my head concerning the direction we had taken,
and my only fear began to be, lest we should arrive
at our destination before his stock of anecdote was
exhausted. In short, any one who had followed in
our wake, and heard the peals of laughter which
issued from the carriage, would certainly have
thought me to have been as drunk as he. This
mirth, however, at least as far as I was concerned,
was destined to receive a tremendous check by the
stopping of the vehicle, and the sudden appearance
at the door of the officer of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">octroi</i>, who asked for
the toll, which then it was the custom for all private
carriages to pay on leaving the capital.</p>

<p>“‘Good God! where are we?’ exclaimed I, in
alarm, now for the first time, since I had left my
uncle’s presence, remembering the importance of
the errand upon which I had been despatched, his
earnest injunctions to use no delay in paying my
official respects to the minister, and the short space
of time I had allowed myself to execute his command,
even when I had first set out.</p>

<p>“‘At the Barrière des Bonshommes!’ returned
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">employé</i>, slamming the door, and making the
usual sign to the coachman that he might proceed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
“‘Before I had recovered from my astonishment,
the carriage was again flying along the road,
at the full gallop of the horses; and, while I was
bawling myself hoarse, to induce the coachmen to
stop, again was d’Aiguillon roaring with laughter!
I was by this time in a state of great vexation,
which seemed rather to increase than diminish my
friend’s merriment. In vain I pulled the check-string
with all my might, and in despair leaned my
body from the window to make myself heard by the
grinning lackeys: my endeavours to arrest the progress
of the carriage, seemed but to increase the
speed at which we were going.</p>

<p>“‘’Tis useless,’ exclaimed d’Aiguillon, drawing
me back into my seat, ‘the varlets have <em>my</em> orders,
and <em>I</em> am their master <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ne vous déplaise</i>; besides,’
continued he, pulling out his watch, ‘your minister
by this time is as far on the road to Versailles as
we are on this; therefore, let us no longer trouble
our heads about business, but give ourselves up to
pleasure. I promise you as much satisfaction this
evening from the remembrance of our trip, as your
uncle would have promised you from the security
of a good conscience. We are going to spend a
delightful hour, so <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en avant, et vogue la galère</i>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
“‘It was in vain that I protested against the deception
which he had played upon me. The hair-brained
young scamp was too much excited with wine and
merriment to listen to reason, and I, myself, could
not long resist the influence of his piquant wit, his
bon-mots, and comical descriptions, and gave way,
with all the good-will of youth and light-heartedness,
to the mirth of the moment. I really imagined
that he was taking me to some one of the
delightful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petites maisons</i>, with which the environs
of Paris abounded at that time, and that we should
meet some of his joyous friends to spend the night,
as it was evident he had done the one preceding,
in fun and frolic, with one or two of the choice
spirits with whom he associated. Meanwhile, the
carriage went on with increasing rapidity.</p>

<p>“‘Where does your friend reside?’ inquired I.
D’Aiguillon put his finger to his nose, winked
and looked cunning, but said nothing. Ruel,
Nanterre, Bougival, all were passed, and still we
paused not.</p>

<p>“‘We are evidently going to St. Germain,’
thought I. ‘Well, ’tis of no consequence; the
mischief is done, and nothing can save me now
from the minister’s wrath and my poor uncle’s displeasure.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
But no—I was wrong. When we came
to the bottom of the hill upon which is situated
St. Germain, the carriage turned suddenly off the
road to the left, and entered a fine avenue of chestnut trees,
at the end of which I could perceive a
pair of lofty iron gates, and, just peering above the
trees, the numerous chimneys and shining slates,
of what appeared, at the distance, a tolerably-sized
château. The adventure now assumed a different
aspect; and I began to fear that, so far from the
joyous party I had before anticipated, we were
destined to swell the number of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">convives</i> at the
table of some rich old dowager <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en retraite</i>, and
that the treacherous kidnapping of d’Aiguillon was
but a wily invention to diminish his own <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i> by
making me share in it.</p>

<p>“‘But the reproaches which I addressed to
d’Aiguillon were unheard by him; for, having exhausted
his stock of scandal, and being himself
exhausted by the sleepless night he had passed,
he had quietly folded his arms, and sunk back into
a sound and heavy slumber; and, proceeding at the
same rapid pace with which we had set out, up the
avenue within the iron gates, we were soon before
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i>. As the carriage stopped, I rubbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
my eyes, scarcely able to believe my senses. Was I
in a dream? Every object which presented itself to
my astonished, horror-stricken gaze seemed familiar
to my memory. The marble steps—the hedge of
geraniums—the open vestibule with the porphyry
columns—and now the doubt becomes certainty!
The footman who comes with such agility down the
steps to assist us in alighting from the carriage,
wears the livery of—I was in a perspiration from
head to foot—of Madame Dubarri! Yes—the
detestable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaisanterie</i> of d’Aiguillon was now
evident. He had brought me to Luciennes, and
we were standing, four years too late, before the
Pavillon. The trees had grown since I was there
last, therefore I had not at first recognised the
place.</p>

<p>“‘I was now really perplexed and angry, and by
a violent shake awoke the Duke, who, torn thus
rudely from his well-earned slumber, seemed even
more astonished than myself. The door was open,
the steps let down, and the gold-lace varlets waiting
patiently our determination to alight. The situation
was most embarrassing; there was a great deal of
hurry and bustle in the interior of the Pavillon, a
running to and fro in the vestibule, and a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
calling of “Clarisse” and “Marianne.” It was
evident that our arrival had been already perceived,
and had already caused a certain sensation. I was
determined, however, not to lend myself to the
folly of my tipsy friend, and bade the coachman,
in a peremptory tone, to use no delay in turning
his horses, and conveying us back to Paris;
although feeling myself compelled, from the courtesy
due to the fair sex, much against my inclination,
to give some token of my visit; I left my name,
with inquiries after the health of Madame la Comtesse,
and regrets that business in Paris prevented
my alighting to pay her a visit in person. To this
d’Aiguillon, who had been sleeping off, in some
degree, the fumes of the past night, offered no objection.
He had, no doubt, recovered his senses
sufficiently to perceive that he was not in a fit state,
either <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au moral</i> or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au physique</i>, to appear before
the lady, and therefore, to my great delight, remained
silent. We had once more gained the
great gate of the park, and were waiting while the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">concierge</i> was opening to it to let us pass out, when
we were overtaken by one of the countess’s pages,
who came running, panting and breathless, to request,
on the part of his mistress, as a great favour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
that we would return, as she would be quite unhappy
at the idea of losing my visit. Of course
there was no possibility of refusal, and we were
forced to turn back, myself in no very pleasant
mood, as you may imagine, and even d’Aiguillon,
whose impudence equalled that of Don Juan himself,
rather subdued as the moment of trial drew
nigh.</p>

<p>“‘We were ushered into a saloon on the ground-floor,
looking into the garden, where Madame
Dubarri was waiting with evident impatience. I
was indeed quite overcome, almost to embarrassment,
by the eagerness of welcome with which she
received me, and the evident delight with which she
accepted the introduction of my young friend.
Poor Dubarri! the days were gone when her
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i> were crowded with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of the court,
when her boudoir was the rendezvous of all that
was elegant and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">distingué</i> in the capital. The
solitude in which she lived at the Pavilion, for which
she was so unfit, formed a strange contrast to the
crowded gallery at Versailles, where I had seen her
last.</p>

<p>“‘No individual has ever been more calumniated
than the poor, unhappy Dubarri. In most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
histories of “My own Times,” the “Mémoires pour
Servir,” and the Souvenirs of M. This and Madame
That, which have been vomited from the press
during the last fifty years, she has been accused of
every vice, of every crime that perverted human
nature is capable of committing. Nothing was ever
more unjust than these accusations. She had never
forgotten, even amid all her grandeur, her ancient
calling, and always felt a weight of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i>, of which
she complained openly, with the greatest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïveté</i>,
at the pomp and ceremony which surrounded her
at Versailles; and, above all, at the obsequious
homage of which she was the object. She had
succeeded in debasing her royal lover to her own
level; but she was without ambition, and never
sought to raise herself, or to use the influence she
had acquired over the mind of the king for wanton
mischief or malice. In the king’s cabinet, in his
council-cabinet, or in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">galerie des glaces</i>, when
assisting the king in his reception of foreign ambassadors,
she was always the same “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Jeanne la
Folle, de chez la Mère Morry</i>.” She had remained
in everything the very type of the successful members
of the unfortunate class from which she had
been taken. Violent and vindictive against those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
who offended her, her wrath was speedily forgotten
in the more powerful passion for amusement and
pleasure, which seemed, like a very demon, to have
possession of her soul. Night and day, from sunrise
to sunset, was she ever ready for a noisy
game, or a brawling dance.</p>

<p>“‘I think it must have been her very indifference
to the political intrigues going on at court,
which caused her to maintain her influence so long.
Louis Quinze was weary of the propriety of
demeanour and great talents of Madame de Pompadour,
and was glad, for the sake of variety, to
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">encanailler</i> his royalty with the representation, such
as poor “Jeanne la Folle” could give to the life,
of the habits and manners of a class of persons of
whose existence he ought scarcely to have been
aware. One great justice ought to be done to her
memory—she was no hypocrite. She never sought
to play the fine lady, or to assume the airs and
state of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i>. On the contrary, her great
delight was in talking of the <em>happy</em> days of her
youth. I have heard from those who were admitted
to the private <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réunions</i> in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petits appartemens</i>
at Versailles, that no actress ever possessed
greater flexibility of histrionic power than Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Dubarri. Her talent at mimicry and caricature
would have done honour to any stage, and it was
one of the king’s greatest enjoyments to listen to
her description of the scenes and circumstances
with which she had been familiar, before the happy
chance which opened to her a life so different from
that to which she then aspired. It seems that her
comic powers were so great, that the satiated and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennuyé</i> old king was once known to take a brilliant
ring from his finger in the enthusiasm of the moment,
and place it on her own, and, forgetting the presence
of the courtiers, kiss her heartily on both cheeks,
after one of these representations, at the same time
declaring that she had given him more pleasure
than he had ever received from the best actors of
the Comédie Française.</p>

<p>“‘She alone furnished the amusement of the
royal <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petits soupers</i> for many years, and, while the
people imagined that the king had retired for a
while from public affairs, for the benefit of his
health, and to recruit his strength, before entering
on the great measures of reform which he had so
long proposed for the advantage of the nation,
roars of laughter and lewd songs were heard by the
sentinel on duty at the gate of Trianon, issuing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
from the royal retreat, and making him imagine
that he was pacing before one of the unholy dens
which infest the narrow streets of the Quartier de la
Cité.</p>

<p>“‘Six years had elapsed since I had seen Madame
Dubarri. I found her but little altered in
appearance, and much subdued in manner—she
was humbled to the very soul. It was evident
that she was perishing with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i>, not with regret
for the splendour in which she had lived, nor the
power which she might have possessed, had she
so willed, but for the gay and gallant company she
had enjoyed, the laughter, the practical jokes, the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">guerre pampan</i>—a game which she had introduced,
and which was still played at court, although
she was no longer allowed to be there to share in
the mirth which it excited. Her lamentations at
her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">délaissement</i>, as she called the comparative
solitude in which she lived, were at first most
piteous; but, as of old, her griefs were soon forgotten
in the delight of the moment, and she soon
gave way, with all the frankness and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonhomie</i> of
her character, to the unwonted delight imparted by
the visit of two persons who could give her news
of the court, and of what was said and what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
done among those whom, so short a time before,
she had ruled as queen, but whom she could not
now either bribe or flatter into the slightest demonstration
of courtesy.</p>

<p>“‘You are, no doubt, curious to hear an opinion
of Madame Dubarri’s beauty from the lips of one
who has seen her both in the days of her prosperity
and after her downfall. She was a person of
small, almost diminutive stature, extremely frail
and delicate in feature, which saved her from being
vulgar; but, even from the first, she always wore
that peculiarly <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fané</i> look, which she owed to a
youth of dissipation, a maturity of unbounded indulgence.
At the period of my visit, she was about
six-and-thirty years of age, but, from her childlike
form and delicacy of countenance, appeared
much younger, and her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gambades</i>, and unrestrained
gestures of supreme delight, on having, as
she said, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quelqu’un à qui parler</i>, did not seem
displaced. Although alone, and evidently not in
expectation of visitors, her toilet was brilliant and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">recherché</i>, the result of the necessity of killing
time. The portrait, which is popular from the engraving,
in which she is represented sipping coffee,
is the best resemblance of her which has ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
been attempted, and the likeness was most striking
on this day, from her being attired in the same
style as that represented in the picture. I could
see that d’Aiguillon was charmed, and in spite of
the clouds through which his reason had to make
its way, he behaved in a discreet and gentlemanlike
manner.</p>

<p>“‘It really was a curious day, that 16th of
August, 1780—begun in the drawing-room of the
Archbishop of Rheims, listening on bended knee
to the exhortations of the good and pious prelate,
and finished in the boudoir of “Jeanne la Folle!”
It might be taken as the very type of the chaos
which, from one end to the other of the social
system, existed at the period. I was impatient to
return to Paris, and did not wish to prolong my
visit, but the poor comtesse sued so earnestly for
another and another <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit quart d’heure</i>, that I
had not the heart to hurry away. She showed us,
with great complacency, all through the grounds
belonging to the Pavillon, which were really beautiful,
particularly the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jets-d’eau</i> and the artificial
fountains which decorated the gardens; and there
was something particularly touching in the tone in
which she spoke of the kindness of poor “France”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
(the name by which she still designated the late
king), who had caused the water-works of Marly
to be brought down to the Pavillon, in order to
give her a pleasant surprise on her birthday.
Their removal must have cost several millions of
the public money, but what was that compared to
the pleasure of winning a smile of delight from
“Jeanne la Folle!”</p>

<p>“‘On returning to the Pavillon, we found a
splendid collation spread in the saloon. Here was
the ’vantage ground of the Comtesse Dubarri; no
one could better do the honours of a well-served
table. In vain we excused ourselves upon the
plea of our <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">negligé</i> toilet. She would take no
refusal, saying, with a sigh, “I excuse you with all
my heart; and fear not, we are sure to be alone;
there is no danger of intrusion from visitors.”</p>

<p>“‘It was impossible to resist the melancholy
tone in which she uttered the words; and, moreover,
d’Aiguillon was not proof against the assurance
which she gave him that she would make him
judge of the Tokay which King Casimir sent as a
present to Louis XIV. So we yielded to the
gentle violence of the comtesse, and consented to
remain. We were both well rewarded for the good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
deed, each of us in the way most agreeable to
himself—d’Aiguillon with plenteous libations of the
most exquisite wine, and myself with stories and
adventures of the court of Louis Quinze, which to
me served as most precious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">renseignemens</i>, and
gave me the clue to much that has taken place in
France since that time.</p>

<p>“‘As for Madame Dubarri herself, she soon
turned from her lamentations concerning the behaviour
of the young court towards her, to give
herself up to all the merriment of the hour,
and was soon excited by the good fellowship of
d’Aiguillon, whose “discretion” had worn off with
the first few glasses, and who had retrograded into
the same state of hilarity as when he met me in
the morning. I could not quote now one half of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mots</i>, the puns, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quolibets</i>, uttered
during the course of that repast. It was a complete
souvenir of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régence</i>, and I could well
understand that the influence which Madame Dubarri
had possessed over the mind of the king had
owed its origin to the nature of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">joyeux propos</i>
with which her conversation teemed, and which to
Louis Quinze must have worn the mask of originality,
as it was not probable that he could ever
have heard the like before. I know not what hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
of the night it could have been when we rose from
table, of course much too late to think of returning
home.</p>

<p>“‘We adjourned to the boudoir of the comtesse—a
delicious retreat which poor “France” had taken
a pleasure in adorning with his own hands—and
here the gaiety of the pair became even more uproarious.
Madame Dubarri told us much of her
past life, never sparing details which would have
excited astonishment, even had she told them of
another, but which, related of herself, became
unaccountable. She showed us, among other
curiosities which the boudoir contained, a little
volume, richly bound in white silk, and which
consisted of the manuscript journal of the king,
during an absence of a few days that he was once
compelled to make at Versailles, while she remained
at Fontainebleau. By one of those curious chances,
which I believe happen to all who <em>observe</em>, my eye
fell upon a passage which immediately set at rest,
in my mind, the long discussions and disputes
which had been excited concerning the dismissal
of M. de Choiseul from the ministry. It ran thus,
and forget not, that it was in the handwriting of
the king himself.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Friday, 10th.</i>—Sent off the courier with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
morning billet to you, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ma chère</i>, then arose. Looked
from the window to see if the weather would be fine
for the hunt. Saw on the wall of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cours des
Veneurs</i>, an impertinent allusion to somebody,
chalked in letters large enough for me to read even
at that distance. One of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">valets de meute</i> must
have been the perpetrator. Left my chamber in
great anger. Found M. de Choiseul waiting in my
study. Showed him the writing, took occasion to
say (as much for himself, as in reference to the
offence of which I complained) all the good I know
(and it is not a little) of somebody. Wishing to
anticipate all the malicious thoughts which I feared
my unrestrained praise of somebody might give rise
to in his mind, said, in conclusion, “After all, the
worst that can be said is, that I succeeded Saint
Foix in her affections.” “Exactly so, sire,” muttered
Choiseul, “just as your majesty succeeded to King
Pharomond, as sovereign of this country.” I did
not choose to speak further on this subject, so
changed the conversation. Choiseul likes an innocent
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaisanterie</i>, but there is no harm in Choiseul.”</p>

<p>“‘Upon what a slight thread will sometimes
hang the destinies of men and of nations! Is it not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
evident that this “innocent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaisanterie</i>,” as it was
called by the good-natured but obtuse Louis Quinze,
was of the kind most likely to inflame the hasty,
choleric temper of Jeanne la Folle? In my own
mind, I feel perfectly convinced that it was this ill-timed
joke of the minister which caused his disgrace,
as I find upon reference to dates, that it was upon
the king’s return to Fontainebleau that the famous
scenes of the oranges, “Saute Choiseul—Saute Praslin,”
was enacted, and both Choiseul and Praslin
were disgraced. It was evident that the page had
been often read, for it was worn, and the writing in
some places dimmed, as if with tears. Perhaps it
was this circumstance which had caused the book
to open just at this very passage, and rendered me
the involuntary sharer in a secret which is not generally
known even to this day.</p>

<p>“‘After we had sufficiently examined all the
curiosities and expensive baubles with which the
boudoir was decorated, Madame Dubarri, whose
dread of seeing us depart seemed to increase as
the hours flew by, then insisted on displaying the
jewels which “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ce cher France</i>” had given her on
various occasions. It was, indeed, a splendid
sight; but, when I complimented her upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
possession of the finest rubies I had ever beheld, she
shook her head mournfully, and said with a sigh,
that she would give them all for a few days participation
in the rejoicings which were going on <em>there</em>
(she pointed to Versailles), not as she once had
been, planner and promoter, but even as mere
spectator. I asked why she did not seek forgetfulness
in change of scene; why she did not travel.
No, she could not tear herself away from the spot
where she had reigned so long; she still had hope
that the young queen would consent to receive her
at court; she scarcely seemed to care upon what
footing she was admitted, so long as she were
allowed to join in the gaieties and festivities which
were going on, almost beneath her very eye, and
from which she felt it such a misfortune to be thus
excluded.</p>

<p>“‘Her emotion was but momentary, however;
for with the tears which the memory of the change
in her situation had called up still in her eyes, she
turned to my companion, and defied him to a game
at <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bilboquet</i>, declaring that she had, in former times,
passed whole hours at this play with the king, who
was passionately fond of it, but could never win
when she was his adversary. D’Aiguillon readily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
consented, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bilboquets</i> were brought, and more
wine was served. In spite of the noisy rattle of the
balls, and the noisier laughter and loud disputing
of the players, I fell asleep, nor did I awake until
daylight. To my astonishment, I found the comtesse
and her host as eager and busy in the childish
game as when they first began—not a whit fatigued,
and seemingly disposed to continue for some hours
longer. D’Aiguillon was by this time totally incapable
of understanding my meaning when I warned
him that it was time to go; and I withdrew unobserved,
resolving to return alone to Paris, leaving
him to finish the adventure as best he could.</p>

<p>“‘Just as I reached the gate, I perceived the
royal hunt dashing down the side of the hill,
and was glad to conceal myself behind the wall
until the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> had passed by, ashamed of being
seen issuing from the dwelling of Madame Dubarri,
although well aware that there was not one of those
dainty courtiers, who now passed by with head
averted and with eyes cast down, who had not
thought it the greatest honour, but a short time
before, to be admitted within the walls of that self-same
Pavillon, which they seemed now to shun
with such disdain. This circumstance would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
too trifling to mention, were it not for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moral</i> it
contains; finer, because <em>true</em>, than all those which
flourish just above the vignette at the close of the
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Contes Moraux</i>” of Marmontel, or those “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dédiés
à la Jeunesse</i>” by Madame de Genlis.’</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand paused, with that peculiar
smile on his countenance which those who live in
his intimacy, know so well, as being meant to fill
the place of some satirical trait which he does not
choose to utter at the time, but which is not
wholly lost notwithstanding.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, this was the last time I ever beheld the
Comtesse Dubarri, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ex-maîtresse en titre</i>. As for
d’Aiguillon, so enchanted did he seem with his new
acquaintance, that, from that day forward, he spent
a great portion of his time at the Pavillon; and,
when I rallied him upon the attraction which
seemed so irresistible, and reminded him of Ninon
de L’Enclos and Diane de Poitiers, he shrugged
his shoulders, and answered me with the greatest
coolness—“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Que voulez-vous, mon cher?</i> where on
earth could I go to get such exquisite Tokay as
that which the old fool, King Casimir, sent as a
present to Louis XIV.?” By this I judged, when
his absences became less frequent, that the Tokay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
was drawing to a close, and when they ceased
altogether, that it had totally disappeared. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Autre
moralité!</i> as dear old Perrault has it at the end of
his fairy tales.’</p>

<p>“The prince paused again more thoughtfully,
and added, ‘Alas! it makes one’s heart ache to
remember the sad fate which befel both of those
gay, light-hearted individuals. The one died upon
the scaffold for having sold her jewels (the jewels
she had shewn me with such pride as the gifts of
poor dear “France”) to send the money which
the sale produced to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">émigré noblesse</i>—that
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i> who had treated her with such scorn—with
such contempt! The other met a death more
frightful still—the gay, the witty, the high-born
d’Aiguillon fled to Holland, and perished there,
they say, of misery and <em>starvation</em>!’</p>

<p>“This souvenir of Madame Dubarri,” said C.,
“forms one of the prince’s favourite <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nouvelles de
boudoir</i>, as he gracefully calls these fugitive anecdotes
with which his memory is stored. I have
observed that, from his youth upwards, his heart
has ever softened towards the fair sex. I never
heard him speak disparagingly of any woman, not
even of those who, he is aware, have done him ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
offices; while he is ever ready to allow that he
owed much of his success in early life to the kindness
and protection of his female friends. They
alone had tact and penetration enough to discover
the future influence of the Abbé de Perigord; while
their ‘lords and masters’ beheld in him nothing
more than the blind tool of an insane and furious
party. Madame de Staël, who was his first conspicuous
protectress, inspired, notwithstanding this,
far less gratitude in the mind of her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protegé</i> than
the humble confederate with whom she leagued to
obtain his pardon and recall, Madame de la Bouchardie.
You will smile when I tell you, that even
to this hour he cannot speak of this charming
woman without emotion. I myself have heard his
voice falter when he has mentioned her name. He
loves to talk of her with those who still remember
the matchless graces of her person, the exquisite
sensibility and goodness of her heart.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget the reply he made one day
to my foolish <em>banal</em> question of ‘What kind of person
was she?’</p>

<p>“‘You could no more understand what <em>kind</em> of
person she was,’ he replied, with a contemptuous
smile, ‘than <em>I</em> can comprehend the admiration you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
bestow upon the poor, vapid puppets with which
your modern drawing-rooms are filled, or the influence
you allow to the female <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoise</i>, the
wives and daughters of your bankers, and your
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agents de change</i>, who, if admitted at all to the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i> of the aristocracy of my day, would not occupy,
as they now do, the high places, but those
afar off, nearest the door. Any endeavour to make
you understand the peculiar fascination of Madame
de la Bouchardie would be useless; for you, in your
generation, cannot have seen the like. She belonged
to that class of women that followed the
downfall of the monarchy, whose manners and
habits were far different from those of the charming
marquises of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ancien régime</i>, and were, perhaps,
even more charming still. Born amid strife and
contention, daughters of the revolution, their part
was to calm excitement, to soothe the angry passions
which had been aroused, and well did they
fulfil their gentle destiny. History will preserve
the names of Madame Beauharnais, of Madame
Tallien, of Madame Hamelin, not so much for
their talents and courage as for their gentleness
and influence in turning aside wrath, and saving
the weak from the fury of the strong.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
“It is pleasant to listen to the praises of this
fair and gentle creature from the lips of M. de
Talleyrand, mingled as they are with the expression
of the gratitude which time has not yet diminished
towards her. The only <em>romantic</em> incident in the
whole life of the prince is connected with Madame
de la Bouchardie, and there lies, perhaps, the
secret of the tenderness with which he remembers
her; while the gratitude which he is <em>compelled</em>
to feel towards her proud rival, Madame de
Staël, has left him cold and unimpassioned. The
latter, who, by her own confession, envied the
grace she could not imitate, was bound by the ties
of friendship to Madame de la Bouchardie, and
disdained not to make use of her influence when
occasion required; and often was her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>
severely wounded to find that those in power, who
had been proof against her own blandishments,
yielded at once, with scarcely an effort at resistance,
to the wondrous fascination of Madame de
la Bouchardie. The comtesse occupied at that
time a small hotel, not far from the site of the
Bastille, and here she sought to live in retirement;
but this was soon discovered to be no easy matter
for one whose name had already been immortalized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
in some of the most glowing verses in the language,
and her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> soon became the rendezvous of all
the wit and talent of the capital.</p>

<p>“The young General Buonaparte was one of
her most ardent admirers; ’tis even said that she
had precedence of Josephine Beauharnais in his
affections. Her answer to his proposal of marriage
is well known, and proves that she already felt a
presentiment of his future greatness. ‘No, general,
you will advance too far for one like myself, who
loves to remain stationary.’</p>

<p>“Joseph Chénier, the poet, the dramatist, the
ardent republican, had also laid his talents and
his triumphs at her feet, and it was upon his influence
that Madame de Staël had reckoned to obtain
the recall from exile of M. de Talleyrand. It was
a work of time and patience, and required all the
power of the one, all the more powerful weakness
of the other, to obtain even so much as a hearing
for their bold demand. At length, the fair Eugénie
had recourse to a graceful expedient, which had
more effect than all the philosophical reasonings of
her learned friend. It was the custom of Chénier
to spend his evenings at the little Hôtel d’Esparda,
and there, in the society of the comtesse and Corinne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
after a day spent in toil and strife, amid the
loud uproar of the tribune, or the furious declamation
of the club, would he love to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">retremper son
âme</i> and imbibe fresh inspiration for the composition
of those splendid odes with which he has
enriched our language. He was accompanied in
these visits by his little dog, Stella, which had been
a present from the comtesse, and knew her well.
The little animal was in the habit of running on
before her master to the hotel, where she would
bark and scratch for the porter to open the gate,
so that her master might not be kept waiting.
Madame de la Bouchardie was aware of this, and,
every evening, at the well-known signal which announced
the approach of Chénier, she would seat
herself at the harp and begin to sing the beautiful
touching ballad of <cite>Le Proscrit</cite>. Her voice was
most splendid, and she possessed great talent as a
composer, having herself set to music many of
those exquisite ballads written by Chénier’s brother,
André.</p>

<p>“This was the sure way to reach the poet’s soul.
She well knew that he stood without and listened
to the end, not daring to enter while the fascination
lasted. When at length the ballad was concluded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
and Madame de la Bouchardie had risen from the
instrument, she was sure to behold Chénier standing
on the threshold, leaning against the doorway,
with saddened countenance, and tears glistening in
his eyes. It was then, while still beneath the spell
of that heavenly strain, that he was greeted with
the words, which must at such a moment have
sunk deep into his heart: ‘Dear Joseph, what has
been done to-day for M. de Talleyrand?’ For
some time the devoted friends had to sustain discouraging
refusals or embarrassed excuses on the
part of Chénier, but the stern principles of the republican
yielded at last to the generous perseverance
of the comtesse, and one evening he was
enabled to answer the accustomed question by the
information that the Convention had consented to
listen to the justification of citizen Maurice, and
that he himself was appointed to plead the cause
of the exile on the morrow. The whole evening
was spent by the three friends in fixing what should
be said, what arguments used, to move the pity of
his listeners, most of whom were disposed against
the measure which he was about to propose. The
night passed away in the amicable discussion; so
anxious were the trio not to lose a single advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
of argument which could be given in Chénier’s
speech.</p>

<p>“The keen wit of Madame de Staël and the
fiery energy of Chénier were for ever coming in
contact, and causing the whole fabric of the poet’s
intended <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaidoyer</i> to fall to the ground, after it had
been raised with so much care and pains. Sometimes
the gentle spirit of Eugénie would suggest
some conciliatory word which would flatter the
irritable self-love of both her friends and soothe
their wounded vanity, and again they would go on
smoothly with their task until fresh cause of difference
arose, and Eugénie was again appealed to.
It was thus that, with these petty causes of delay,
morning had arrived and no speech was prepared,
and Chénier went forth to the tribune disheartened
and discouraged at the unwonted sterility of his
imagination, dreading, after all, that his own want
of eloquence might cause the appeal in favour of
M. de Talleyrand to be rejected by the assembly.
He found the indefatigable friends already arrived,
and waiting in the ante-room. Madame de Staël
submitted to his judgment several new reasonings
which had entered her mind since he had left her,
but they found poor Chénier still cold and uninspired;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
and, as he turned to enter the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salle</i> where
the members of the Convention were fast assembling,
he said, in despair, ‘Pray for me, for I need
it; I fear that I shall have no success in this cause,
though you have made it yours.’</p>

<p>“Madame de la Bouchardie approached and
laid her hand upon his arm. She looked up into
the face of the poet with a countenance bathed in
tears. Chénier tried to tear himself away, but she
still detained him, and, in a low, tremulous voice,
fearful of being overheard by those beyond the
door, she sang the opening couplet of the ballad
which had first roused him to exertion for the sake
of the exile. She saw by his heightened colour
and his quivering lip that he was moved, and, as
she proceeded with the song, her own emotion became
more painful still. Just as she concluded,
the bell, which summoned the assembly to silence
and attention, was heard, and Chénier rushed into
the hall with that powerful emotion still upon his
soul. Before the last strain uttered by those sweet
tones had died upon his ear, he had mounted the
tribune, and without forethought, without preparation,
gave utterance, in impassioned language, to
one of the most brilliant appeals which had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
been pronounced before that stern, unpitying
senate. Enthusiasm was roused; the motion, supported
by Legendre and Boissy, was carried without
a murmur, and citizen Maurice was declared
free to return to France whenever it might suit his
own pleasure. Madame de Staël, by her interest
with Barras, certainly forwarded the measure, and
she has reaped the fame, while Madame de la
Bouchardie has gathered all the gratitude.</p>

<p>“The first visit of M. de Talleyrand on his arrival
in Paris, was, of course, to Chénier, and it
was agreed between them that they would proceed
together that same evening to the little Hôtel
d’Esparda, which no longer echoed with the prayers
and lamentations of the two fair <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">solliciteuses</i>, but
had once more resumed its tone of gaiety and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">insouciance</i>
ever since the successful termination of their
efforts in favour of their absent friend. Chénier
entered the drawing-room alone, requesting M. de
Talleyrand to remain for a moment in the shadow
of the doorway. By a little artifice he led the
conversation to the subject of the exile, and both
Madame de Staël and her friend expressed anxiety
and surprise that he had not yet arrived from
Berlin. They complained of this delay, reproaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
him with coldness and ingratitude in thus remaining
so long in voluntary banishment.</p>

<p>“‘Were he to hear your ballad of the “Proscrit,”
it would hurry his return,’ said Chénier to Madame
de la Bouchardie, at the same time taking her by
the hand, and leading her to the harp, and Eugénie,
although declaring that the song was a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pièce de
circonstance</i> and out of date, yielded to his entreaty
that she would sing it; and, finding inspiration
in the remembrances which the music called
up, she gave it with all the impassioned energy
which had before roused the soul of her lover to
pursue with such unwearied perseverance the cause
he had himself at first condemned. While she
was singing, M. de Talleyrand had drawn near
unperceived, and when her hand fell to her side at
the conclusion of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ritournelle</i>, he seized it in a
transport of delight, and imprinted on those fairy
fingers a fervent kiss of gratitude. The loud shriek
of surprise uttered by Madame de la Bouchardie
roused Madame de Staël from the reverie into
which the melody of the voice of her friend never
failed to plunge her. In an instant, the arms of
both ladies, with the true republican <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans gêne</i> of
the day, were around the neck of the happy ‘Proscrit,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
and while Madame de Staël expressed with
fluency all the joy she felt at again beholding him,
the Comtesse de la Bouchardie shed tears of happiness,
more eloquent in their silence than all the
florid declamations of her friend. It would enchant
you to hear the prince describe that scene,
the mixture of the burlesque and the pathetic which
he can paint so well.”</p>

<p>“What became of Madame de la Bouchardie?”
said I. “Her name is never mentioned in the
annals of that time, and yet it seems difficult to
suppose that she could have sunk so completely
into obscurity as to have left no trace. The friend
of Buonaparte and Talleyrand, the mistress of
Chénier, the companion of Corinne, must of necessity
have been a personage of note, not a mere
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comparse</i> to occupy the back of the stage.”</p>

<p>“Alas! you should not have asked me this,”
said C., mournfully. “It seems as if a curse hung
over all that was fair and virtuous at that stormy
time. There is a tale connected with Madame de
la Bouchardie, of such frightful injustice, of such
base ingratitude, that it would harrow up your soul
were I to tell it. At Chénier’s death, she went to
live on her estate, but was brought back to Paris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
some few years ago, a confirmed, incurable lunatic.
When the prince seems overcome by sadness, and
calls for his carriage before the hour at which he is
accustomed to take his daily drive, I know almost
by instinct that Dr. E. has been closeted with him
for some time—and I can easily guess who has
formed the melancholy subject of their conference.”</p>

<p>“The sudden change from the frivolous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">papillotage</i>
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ancien régime</i> to the sombre enthusiasm
which broke out at the epoch of the
American war, made but little impression on M. de
Talleyrand. He was evidently prepared, and at
once declared his opinion, not by pamphlets or
inflammatory speeches, but by an argument far
more forcible than either. Conjointly with his
friend, the Count Choiseul Gouffier, he equipped
a privateer, which he called the ‘Holy Cause,’ and
which left the harbour of Brest in the month of
May, 1779. The Duc de Castries, then minister
of marine, furnished the guns. This single fact
would almost serve to paint the time. A vessel of
war armed and equipped by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agent-général du clergé de France</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
aided by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savant</i> of the <i>haute
noblesse</i>, and countenanced by one of the ministers,
exhibits at once the utter confusion of ideas which
must have existed just then.</p>

<p>“I have heard that the privateer, which, placed
under command of a runaway scion of nobility,
was to have carried death and destruction among
the English merchant ships trading from the West
Indies, never more made its appearance on the
French coast. Be this as it may, I know that the
prince does not like to talk of this little episode in
his life, and the other day, when questioned rather
closely upon the subject, he answered, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Laissons
cela, c’est un de mes péchés de jeunesse</i>.’</p>

<p>“One of the most curious documents in the
world, and which I hope will be preserved in the
prince’s memoirs, must be his answer to the letter
of Pope Benedict XIV. His holiness had thought
fit to pass censure upon the warlike demonstration
of the Abbé de Perigord, and the Abbé de Perigord
had excused himself in a reply so full of wit and
eloquence, so full of instances taken from the
history of every country, that the good-natured
prelate fairly owned himself vanquished, and withdrew,
with much grace and frankness, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
contest. This I think is the first action by which
the Abbé de Perigord publicly displayed his adherence
to the new principles, and separated himself
in opinion from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haute clergé</i> and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haute
noblesse</i>, who all, with scarcely an exception, were
loud in their disapprobation of the unjust and
unjustifiable interference of France in the quarrel
between Great Britain and her rebellious colony.
The step was considered in the light of a secession
from the society of which he was a member, both
by his lofty birth and holy profession; and many
and many a prognostic was now beginning to be
drawn of his future eminence or his approaching degradation,
according to the mind which judged him.</p>

<p>“It was during the few years which elapsed
between this period, and the events of 1789, that
M. de Talleyrand first became acquainted with
the Abbé Cerutti, the friend and colleague of
Mirabeau, and that, together with them, he laid
the foundation of the very first popular journal
ever published in France. The design was spirited
and bold; it was addressed to the inhabitants of
the distant provinces of the kingdom; and, immediately
on its appearance, obtained a success
hitherto unrivalled in this species of literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
“It has been falsely accused of having excited
many of the atrocities of the Revolution. It did
not appear until the flames had spread, and could
no longer be repressed, and he who now turns to
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Feuille Villageoise</i>, will recognise at once,
amid the burning columns from the pen of Mirabeau,
and the cold, bitter irony of Cerutti, the
calm reflective genius of Talleyrand, in those
articles on the Division of Church Property—on
the Improvements in National Education—on the
Abuse of Power—on the Unity of Weights and
Measures—which served to act as soothing balsam
to the irritation produced by the fiery appeals of
his more impassioned colleagues.</p>

<p>“He puts forth, in these addresses to the people,
the promulgation of which has been deemed so
criminal, nothing which he had not said before—not
a single word of which he does not retain the
most powerful conviction, ay, even to this very
hour. Some of them might be quoted as models
of reasoning and eloquence, although failing in the
refinement of style and diction, which can only be
acquired by that early familiarity with the classics,
the want of which he has lamented all his life.</p>

<p>“Cerutti was a man gifted with the most splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
talents. His peculiar position claimed, perhaps,
undue attention, from the very moment when
he first appeared upon the revolutionary horizon.
The reception of this champion of the people was
most enthusiastic. Wherever he went, he was
followed by an admiring crowd—every public
meeting resounded with his praise—streets were
called after his name; in short, he tasted every
gratification of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i> arising from popularity.
But Cerutti was a misanthrope, and, far
from seeking distinction, he shrank with disgust
from publicity. The canker-worm was at his heart,
and I have heard M. de Talleyrand declare that,
during the whole time their intimacy lasted, he never
once beheld him smile. His was another of those
anomalous existences created by the revolution.
A gentleman, bred in indolence, yet adopting the
obligations and active vigilance of a Jesuit; then
becoming even a priest, the better to defend the
cause of his beloved order; chosen as the private
counsellor and friend of the dauphin (father of
Louis Seize), and then suddenly—without pause,
without gradation,—plunging headlong into the
delirium of democracy.</p>

<p>“It is singular that the cause of this unnatural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
course of events should never have been thoroughly
investigated by any of the historians of the time,
who all seem to agree in passing over without
comment the motives which actuated Cerutti, or
else in declaring them either altogether inscrutable
or the instigations of insanity. The close observer
of the human heart can, however, at once discern
the existence of some secret spring of action, some
powerful incentive to this inconsistency, and will
not remain satisfied with the abuse heaped upon
poor Cerutti by the Abbé Georgel, the wordy historian
of the diamond necklace, defender, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coûte
que coûte</i>, of Louis de Rohan; nor yet with the
light indifference with which he is mentioned by
another author, who describes him in these words—‘A
man of some capacity both as an orator and
writer, but whose career was too short to allow him
to display that ability in government which he
seemed confident of possessing. He was of a
sombre and taciturn character, which, combined
with his almost total deafness, rendered him of
difficult access. ’Tis said that the hopeless passion
he had conceived for one of the ladies of the
court brought on paralysis, which occasioned his
infirmity, and ultimately ended in his death.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
“I have heard the history of Cerutti from M. de
Talleyrand himself, and it forms one of the most
extraordinary episodes of this extraordinary time.
The prince related to me that, one evening after
their work was over, the three <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">collaborateurs</i> of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Feuille Villageoise</i>, led on by the very nature of
the composition upon which they had been engaged,
began to talk of the events of their past
lives, and of the various causes which had led to
the desertion of caste, of which all three had been
guilty. What a glorious study would it have been
for the moralist, to have listened to those dark
histories, as told by those three fiery spirits, each
the hero of his own bitter tale. One can imagine
all the hatred and the scorn of Mirabeau, as he
related the circumstances of his youth of strife and
misery; of his manhood, crushed and blighted by his
father’s unjust tyranny; his burning satire and his
bitter scoffing must have been terrific. Then came
the calm, deep mockery of Talleyrand; <em>his</em> history
of neglect and injustice must have been more
frightful still. Three mighty souls were they, rising
in condemnation of the country and the times
in which they had thus been spurned and persecuted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
“Every one knows the history of Mirabeau’s
long imprisonment and harsh treatment, and I have
already told you the events which marked the
youth of Talleyrand; but the story of Cerutti is
known only to the few with whom he was most intimate,
and is, perhaps, more illustrative of the
spirit of the times than that of either of his friends.
The man’s career was short, and very like the flash
which precedes the tempest—everything, while he
was on the stage moving before the public eye—nothing,
so soon as his part was over and the curtain
dropped. He died and left nought behind to
save him from oblivion—not even the memory of
the manner in which he had performed his character,
and in which he had been so much applauded.</p>

<p>“His father was a wealthy silk-grower in the
environs of Turin, and his childhood was passed
amid the shady groves, which stretched for miles
around the château where his family resided. His
younger brother had taken to books and learning,
and had been appointed to accompany the young
Count Hercules V—— on his travels; while Joseph
Cerutti, the eldest of the family, remained at home
to assist his father in the direction of his fortune
and the improvement of the estate. His life was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
that of an Italian gentleman of the middle class at
the time—that is to say, his studies were neither
very deep nor his occupations very grave, and his
days passed pleasantly enough in the exercise of
small practices of piety, the cultivation of small
adventures of gallantry, very little reading, and
great indulgence in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dolce far niente</i>; added
to which, he was compelled to superintend the progress
of the silkworms, which formed the whole
wealth of the father and the patrimony of his sons.
But this occupation was far from being sufficiently
interesting to rouse him from the dream in which
he lived, and in which his days might all have
passed, had it not been for the one event which,
sooner or later, will turn the tide of all men’s lives,
making the hitherto troubled sea of existence at
once calm and placid, or changing its smooth surface
into a raging hell.</p>

<p>“Count Hercules V—— returned from Rome,
whither he had been journeying with young Cesario
Cerutti, the brother of our hero. The estate of
the noble family of V—— joined that of the
Cerutti, and from the friendship which existed
between the young nobleman and the companion
of his studies, sprung an intimacy between the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
families, which was at variance with the Italian
habits of the period, wherein distinctions and caste
were more respected than in any other country in
Europe.</p>

<p>“‘I was struck,’ said the Abbé Cerutti, as he
told the story to his fellow-labourers, ‘with the
change which a few months had made in the habits
and temper of my brother Cesario. He had left
us full of the enthusiasm and spirit natural to his
age; he had returned taciturn and reserved in
speech, gloomy and abstracted in manner. He
seemed to have a weight of care and misery upon
his mind, which neither the affectionate attentions
of his family nor the fondness of his mother, to
whom he was devotedly attached, could succeed in
shaking off. I observed that he was for ever
seeking me, and requesting me to converse in
private with him, as though he had something of
moment to communicate; and then he would
suddenly check himself, and talk of light matters,
so much in contrast with the mournful tone of his
voice and the gloom upon his brow, that the contemplation
was most painful. But I dared not
question him concerning the cause of this change
in his disposition, fearing to exasperate him, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
irritable mood in which he was. One day, when he
seemed more communicative than usual, I sought
to enliven our conversation by endeavouring to
extort from him some little narrative of his journey
to Rome, concerning which he had hitherto observed
an unnatural silence.</p>

<p>“‘He said he had been happy, very happy with
Count Hercules (and yet he shuddered as he spoke
the words,) and the kindness of the good Abbé
Giordoni, the young Count’s preceptor, had so
mingled pleasure with study, that the time had
passed away swiftly and pleasantly as in a charmed
dream. Why then did he gaze upon me with
that strange expression in his eye? I could not
resist the impulse which prompted me to seize the
opportunity of seeking to discover the cause of
his melancholy, and said, as I pressed his hand
with affection, “Dearest Cesario, do not suffer the
secret which hangs so heavy on your soul to crush
you thus beneath its ponderous weight. Confide
in me, my brother. What is it has disturbed your
happiness, and thus changed your very nature?”</p>

<p>“‘You are deceived,’ replied Cesario, hastily,
and with a kind of convulsive laugh; ‘I never was
more happy or in better spirits than at this moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Come with me this evening to the Villa V——, and
see if it be not as I tell you. By-the-bye, I had
forgotten to mention, that the whole family at the
villa are anxious to welcome you, the old count and
his son, and the abbé, and—and—(he hesitated)—in
short, the whole of them will be glad to see
you. So come to-night—yes, to-night—’tis time!’</p>

<p>“‘His head sank upon his bosom as he concluded,
and he once more relapsed into his abstracted
musing. I made no observation regarding
the singular forgetfulness of which he had been
guilty, nor of the want of attention on the part of
the V—— family, in not inviting me themselves to
the villa, but seized with avidity upon the opportunity
thus afforded of penetrating the secret of my
brother’s altered demeanour. I already knew Count
Hercules, a studious and pious youth, who was
considered a pattern for the whole country. I had
also frequently seen the Abbé Giordoni, the preceptor,
towards whom I felt an instinctive aversion,
although railed at by my friends for my too great
facility, in “taking dislikes;” but there yet remained
one member of the V—— family whom I had not
yet beheld, and a sudden conviction seized my
mind, that she was the cause of my brother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
misery, and that it was her name at which he had
hesitated in his speech to me. I was therefore
determined to watch every look, to listen to every
word, which should pass between the pair, and to
base my counsels to my brother upon what I should
observe.</p>

<p>“‘At the hour appointed, we set forth to pay our
evening visit at the villa. The gloom and pre-occupation
of my brother increased as we drew
near to our destination, and I began to doubt if
such would have been the bearing of an impassioned
expectant lover.</p>

<p>“‘We entered the great saloon unannounced.
Cesario was free and intimate as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fils de la maison</i>.
The room was large, and dimly lighted by the shaded
lamp upon the mantelpiece. The old count was
buried in a slumber in his large arm-chair, and his
grey head stood out from the fauteuil, calm and
peaceful, the very emblem of contented and respectable
old age. Not so was the expression of the
individual who was seated near, and upon whom
the light of the lamp fell, as if on purpose to light
up the shadow which was passing at the very moment
over his countenance—a very gleam of hell!
It was the Abbé Giordoni, who was seated at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
small table, ostensibly playing chess with the young
Count Hercules—that is to say, the chess-board
was placed between them, and the chess-men stood
upright upon the board; but I instantly perceived
that not one single piece had been disturbed from
its primitive position, and it was evident that their
occupation was of far more import, for the young
man sat pale and trembling before the abbé,
whose infuriated countenance and vehement gesture
plainly bespoke the violence of the discussion
in which he had been engaged, although I could
not judge of its nature, from the low tone in which
it had been carried on, doubtless through fear of
disturbing the poor old count, who slumbered on,
little dreaming of the storm of hate and passion
which had been conjured up close at his very ear.</p>

<p>“‘Our entrance disturbed the conversation, and
I was painfully struck with the eagerness of welcome
with which Count Hercules rushed forward
to greet my brother; and which, considering that
he had already seen him in the morning, and that
almost every day since his return had been spent
in his company, seemed forced and unnatural. He
started from his chair, upsetting the table and the
chess-board in his haste, and throwing his arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
around my brother’s neck, he exclaimed, faintly,
“God be praised, you are come at last, Cesario!”</p>

<p>“‘The abbé, meanwhile, advanced towards me
with ecclesiastical grace and dignity. I ought at
once to have suspected the man who could so
easily replace the expression of rage which his
features wore when I entered, by the smile of intense
delight with which he held forth his hand to me,
uttering, by a singular coincidence, almost the very
words which Count Hercules had whispered to my
brother, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eccolo alfin—questo caro amico</i>.”</p>

<p>“‘I ought to have suspected such heartiness of
welcome from one who had displayed hitherto no
stronger feeling towards me than that of common
courtesy, whenever by chance we had met, which
was but seldom, in our walks and drives around the
neighbourhood. I could understand such warmth
of greeting between the two young friends, but was
sorely puzzled to discover by what right and title <em>I</em>
was admitted to share in such strong demonstrations
of friendship. However, any feeling of astonishment
which I might have experienced was soon
forgotten in the courteous reception which I met with
from the old count, who, thus rudely roused from
slumber, by the falling of the table and the upsetting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
of the chess-men, rose to meet us with all the
frank politeness which has ever distinguished the
Piedmontese gentlemen of the old school, and completely
put me at my ease, by immediately entering
upon the subject which he knew would be most
interesting to me, the improvement of my father’s
land, and the culture of our mulberry-grounds.
The two young men were soon engaged in deep
and earnest conversation together, and the Abbé
Giordoni shaded his eyes with his hand and attentively
watched them both.</p>

<p>“‘The evening passed pleasantly enough, but
I thought of little beside the young countess,
whom I had not yet seen, and, when the door
opened slowly and she was announced, my heart
beat so violently, for my brother’s sake, that any
one who had witnessed my emotion, would have
imagined that I was already deeply in love with her
myself. She entered without embarrassment, notwithstanding
the presence of the strangers whom
she found assembled in the saloon, and whom she
had not expected to meet there, went up to her
father, and kissed him on the forehead, and then
turning to us, saluted us gracefully. I was struck
with her extreme beauty, and at the first glance felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
sure that my suspicions were right, and that Cesario
was enslaved; but presently all my suspicions fell
to the ground; for, as soon as she caught his eye,
she stepped lightly across the floor, and accosted
him easily and with grace, but with the happy calm
of perfect indifference; while he, although roused
for an instant by the duties of courtesy, having
bowed politely, sank backward in the fauteuil from
which he had risen on her entrance, without a word—without
a glance, for I watched him narrowly—and
resumed the conversation with Count Hercules,
which had been interrupted on her entrance.</p>

<p>“‘I was fairly puzzled by this unexpected <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">denoûment</i>
to the intrigue I had been at so much
pains to invent. It was in vain that I sought to
detect the slightest intelligence between them—there
was none. The young girl seemed engrossed
during supper by her attentions to her father, and
scarcely raised her eyes towards any of us, save in
the courtesy which she might consider to be due
from the hostess to her guests; whilst my brother,
whose seat at table was immediately opposite to
hers, never once even glanced towards her. I left
the villa that night full of strange feelings, and from
that hour my existence was changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
“‘How <em>can</em> I tell you, my friends, how it became
so? I know not myself, save that a web was
spun around me, from which I am not free at this
very hour! There seemed, from the very first, an
overstrained demonstration of attachment towards
me, and absolute <em>appropriation</em> of my time and
of my actions, nay, my very thoughts were no more
my own. The Abbé Giordoni was never absent
from my side, and, what seemed stranger still, he
was acquainted with the most minute secrets of our
existence—the value of our land—the produce of
our plantations—the revenue which we drew from
the silkworms; he even knew of the circumstances
of the loan which we had been compelled to raise a
few years before, and which, as we thought, had
been kept a profound mystery between ourselves
and the party of whom the money had been borrowed.
I have lain awake whole nights to discover
how this could be, and yet could not compass the
mystery. I cannot tell you how much this circumstance
preyed upon my spirit, for Heaven had gifted
me with an independent soul, and an utter abhorrence
of control, and the invisible fetters with which
I felt myself manacled became more and more
galling as I grew more determined to be free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
“‘It was on the occasion of my father’s death
that I felt this most of all. The abbé took upon
himself, unsolicited and unapproved, the whole
management of our affairs. He it was who arranged
the retirement of our mother to the neighbouring
convent of the Annunciata, to which I most decidedly
objected; but my opinion in this, as well as
in everything else, was entirely overruled by that
of the abbé. The next occurrence in the family,
which gave me the strangest trouble and perplexity,
was the determination of Cesario to sell the portion
of the estate which had become his by my father’s
will; and my amazement was increased tenfold
upon learning who was the purchaser—it was the
Abbé Giordoni. I was angry with my brother, and
reproached him bitterly, but he replied, in a despairing
voice, and with the tears flowing from his
eyes, “What could I do? The land was needed
by the good abbé!”</p>

<p>“‘My God, what could be the meaning of all
this? How came it that this man had thus obtained
such influence? Day by day did it increase and
grow more irksome, still drawing, as it were, a
charmed circle round my very existence, diminishing
in circumference until it had grown so small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
that I could not even turn without feeling wounded
by its pressure; every day and every hour drew the
coils yet closer. It was then that I ended where I
ought to have begun, and set myself earnestly to
work to examine the character of the man, who
had, in spite of me, gained such ascendancy over
my family. To my great astonishment, I found
him a man of the keenest wit and most consummate
knowledge of the world, whose practical learning
and experience were universal, whose energy
and perseverance were dauntless. I soon discovered,
with a feeling of terror which I cannot describe,
that he had fathomed my character with as much
accuracy as though I had lived with him from my
youth upwards. He <em>knew</em> of my scorn and hatred
of restraint, and therefore had used none. He
<em>knew</em> that I was of a proud and melancholy temperament,
and therefore had never roused my ire
by opposition. I felt a bitter contempt for myself,
when I found that in all things it was his system to
<em>humour</em> me. The hour came at last, however, for
the unravelling of all the mystery.</p>

<p>“‘One day, Giordoni came to me with busy and
important looks, and with a hurried air, to consult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
me upon the plan of a building he was about to erect
upon the ground which he had bought of Cesario.
It was within view of the windows of my own
château, and therefore it was the act of a friend to
consult me upon the form and fashion of its structure,
and, as in duty bound, I thanked him heartily
for the kind attention.</p>

<p>“‘It was a chapel to Saint Ignatius which he
was about to erect, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en attendant</i> the convent,” he
added, with a smile bland and affable, “which it
was his intention to found when he should grow
richer.” The dedication startled me.</p>

<p>“‘Not a convent of Jesuits?’ said I, faintly, for
I had imbibed a share of the popular hatred, which,
just at that time, the Order had inspired throughout
the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>“‘The abbé smiled again, yet more peaceably
than before. “Pardon me,” replied he, in a gentle
tone, “our Order has need of a station in this part
of the country. We are poorly represented, my
friend, observe—” and he drew forth his memorandum-book,
“from Saint Tomaso to Mabli, eight
leagues, from Mabli to this place, seventeen; it is
too far.”</p>

<p>“‘The secret then was out; the whole mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
of the man, his perseverance and his patience, his
confidence in himself, his utter contempt of me.
He was a Jesuit—an active, busy, meddling Jesuit—one
who held a degree in the Order—one who had
command and authority, and could bid any of his
underlings, slaves to his will, who was himself a
slave, do his pleasure at the moment and without a
murmur, even though the order should have been
to murder his best friend, or betray to death his
own mother; who himself durst not hesitate in the
commission of any crime, provided it were done
for the honour and advancement of the “Blessed
Order of Jesus!”</p>

<p>“‘I am now convinced that, natural and simple
as this avowal then appeared, it had been prepared
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de longue main</i>, and that much was at that very
moment depending upon the manner in which it
would be received by me. He managed well, however,
in hiding the emotion which my startled
manner and my exclamations of surprise and displeasure
must have occasioned him, and launched
forth at once, with graceful eloquence, upon the
advantages of the Order of Jesus over all others—the
power, the influence, which the meanest member
of the “Society” possessed over every individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
within his sphere. He said that the confidence
and strength of the association were so great, that
nought could resist its influence. He showed me
on the map how its ramifications had spread
throughout Europe, until they had enveloped every
civilized country as in a web, from which it was
impossible to get free, and, when he had concluded,
he took me out to inspect the workmen at the
chapel, and to view the new plantation which he
had commenced. I beheld it indeed, and with a
sad presentiment remarked that the avenues of
lime trees, which were already laid down, were all
turned in the direction of my own château. I
scarcely knew what it was that I dreaded, and yet
felt a certainty of coming evil which completely
overpowered every faculty.</p>

<p>“‘You will smile at the determination which I
took that very night—you will say that it was that of
a schoolboy—a coward—but you cannot know the
terror which pervaded the population of our country
at that very period, on account of the subtlety of the
Jesuits. It had become the bugbear of society.
The feeling had been nursed by the secret enemies
of the Order, sent from France, where its dissolution
had already been decreed in the boudoirs of
Trianon, by the vindictive hatred of Madame de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Pompadour. I determined, then, to flee—to leave
my property in the hands of the agent, and to
travel for a while, until the power of the serpent
which was thus gaining ground upon me was
weakened, or that I felt myself strong enough to
encounter its cold and slimy coils without fear. I
passed several days in making my preparations for
the journey I meant to take, and confided my intentions
to no one on earth save the overseer of the
estate in whose hands I was about to place my interests.
Cesario was absent. I would not even
venture to write to him until I had set forth, for my
terror of betrayal had grown so puerile that I even
feared the letter might be opened!</p>

<p>“‘Everything was ready for my departure. The
agent, a plain, honest man, had sworn to be as
secret as the grave, and when, one evening, I took
my leave of the eternal Giordoni, who now passed
not a single day without paying me his lengthened
visit, I laughed at his form of farewell. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">À demain,
à demain!</i>” called he from the gate; “to-morrow
we will talk about the road from your grounds to
my chapel—there <em>must</em> be a road, Cerutti—the
high wall must come down. What need of walls
between such friends as we?”</p>

<p>“‘I laughed as I pressed his hand in feigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
warmth, echoing his portentous words of adieu. I
knew that on the morrow I should be far enough
away. He smiled likewise as he exclaimed, once
more looking me earnestly in the face, “Farewell,
my friend, my dearest friend, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à demain donc, à
demain</i>!”</p>

<p>“‘He turned, and I watched his retreating form
gradually fade in the moonlight, with a heart
bounding with gratitude and joy at the prospect of
my approaching deliverance. The horses were
waiting on the by-road by the side of the château,
and I could hear their joyous neigh from the gate
where I was leaning to gaze after Giordoni. Everything
seemed to breathe of peace and happiness.
There was a nightingale perched among the
branches of the mulberry tree beneath which I
stood, and her joyous melody gushed forth unsubdued,
more free and unconstrained methought
when the shadow of Giordoni no longer darkened
the pathway; multitudes of the bright green glow-worms
peculiar to the summer nights of our country,
were chasing each other over the smooth turf.
I thought I had never beheld a night of such calm,
such placid beauty.</p>

<p>“‘I was like the schoolboy about to escape the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
dominion of his pedagogue; eager to be free, yet
scarcely as yet decided on the use that he would
make of his long-coveted liberty. I had many
plans in view, but none as yet decided.</p>

<p>“‘I will go from hence to Lyons,’ said I to
myself, as I returned with light step towards the
house; ‘there will I remain for a while, to study
the manners of the people of whom I have heard
so much; then on—on to Paris; ’tis there and
there alone “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qu’on trouve le génie si on n’en a pas</i>.”
I could scarcely contain my feelings at the thought
of the change which by my own address and discretion
I was about to work in my destiny, and I
whistled and sang aloud in glee at the bare thought
of so much happiness.</p>

<p>“‘No more slavery, no more espionnage, and—shall
I own it, my friends?—no more fear of a
cold and disdainful love! Yes, <em>there</em> was the
secret of the discontented misery of the last few
months of my existence. From the evening of my
first visit at the villa of Count V——, I had become
the slave of the fair Signora Isabella. Her
disdain of my advances, her coldness, had served
to increase my passion, but had changed its character.
Hope had given way to defiance, defiance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
to despair, yet still I loved, <em>and this was the reason
why I wished to flee in secret</em> from the home
where I was born, like a thief or an usurper—this
it was that drove me forth to seek elsewhere the
liberty I felt that I had lost—the repose which I
so greatly needed. All these subjects for the future
passed rapidly through my mind as I returned up
the avenue. I had just gained the hall, I was ascending
the steps which led to my apartment,
when I was startled by the sound of footsteps close
behind me. I was alarmed: I knew that the domestics
had been all dismissed, and had long before
retired from that part of the building, while
the agent had my orders to await me with the
horses. I turned in trepidation, my heart fluttered
in my bosom, and my cheek grew pale as marble—it
was <em>Giordoni who followed me</em>!</p>

<p>“‘Such was the state of abject fear in which I
lived that, in the nervous agitation of the moment,
I was about to confess my guilty design, and to
sue for pardon; but there was neither anger nor
suspicion upon the brow of the Jesuit, and it was
with a calm and gracious smile that he spoke, as he
held up before me a little billet which scented the
air with the sweetest perfume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
“‘See what a faithless messenger am I,’ said he,
shaking his head with a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonhomie</i> quite paternal;
‘I was commissioned to deliver this letter with
great dispatch, and had well-nigh forgotten it altogether!
’Twas well I thought of it before I got
home, for I know not how I might have been received
had I returned without the answer.’</p>

<p>“‘I was seized with sudden faintness as I mechanically
unsealed the billet and gazed at the
signature. It was from the demoiselle Isabella de
V——, and, as I read the contents, my very soul
gave way beneath the influence of the kindness
and the <em>tender</em> tone it breathed.</p>

<p>“‘Need I say that I departed not that night—that
I even retired to rest <em>rejoicing</em> that I had been
prevented from listening to the rash suggestions of
my evil genius, for such I was soon taught to believe
the secret warnings of my better reason, to
which had I but hearkened then, I should have
been saved a whole life of misery.</p>

<p>“‘To you, who are both men of the world, there
is no need to describe the sequel. Before three
months had elapsed, I had become as fervent a
proselyte to the principles which governed the
“blessed Order” as Giordoni himself!—In three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
months more, the land which my father had saved
with so much care and pains, and which I myself
had toiled so assiduously to improve, deeming it
a heritage to descend to my children’s children,
was no longer my own; it belonged by promise to
the holy society of Jesus, of whom I now was
proud to sign myself a weak, unworthy member.
During all this time I had lived in a dream—a
delusion the more wild and stirring, inasmuch as I
am of a cold and torpid character, requiring the
most powerful emotions to rouse me from my
apathy. I do not think that I ever reflected on
the future. It was enough that the Contessa Isabella
loved me. She told me so again and again,
and each time that she had spoken the words, I
had granted some concession of which I repented
not, deeming no sacrifice too great to win that
single smile which I had by this time learned to
prize more highly than my fortune—than my very
life—to deem more precious than my father’s memory
or my mother’s love! I was roused from the
trance into which I had fallen by a letter from my
brother Cesario, which was put into my hand on
my return home late one evening from the villa
V——. It contained but few words, full of darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
and mystery—the restraint of one labouring
under the terror of discovery.</p>

<p>“‘I have much to tell you,’ wrote he; ‘beware!
you are deceived. I shall be with you to-night,
but let it not be known. I wish to say but one
word to you, and must depart again before dawn,
without leaving the slightest trace of my visit. Let
the gate at the bottom of the garden be left unlocked
to-night, and, when all in the château have
retired to rest, meet me by the tank close to the
entrance. Hesitate not—I shall wait there till
you come. You will find upon the first step of
the reservoir a branch of the alder which grows
there, which I will cut the moment I arrive, as a
signal that I am waiting for you.’</p>

<p>“‘I cannot describe to you the perplexity into
which I was thrown by the contents of this letter—nor
the anxiety with which I awaited the opportunity
of complying with the request contained in
it. It seemed as if that moment was destined
never to arrive, so tediously did the evening pass—so
slow did the domestics seem in their preparations
for retiring to rest.</p>

<p>“‘At length all was quiet in the château, and,
with thanks to Heaven that it should at last be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
so, I muffled myself in my cloak, and ventured
forth. The night was dark; there were neither
moon nor stars; but so impressed was I by the
tone of mystery in which my brother wrote, that I
did not even carry with me the lantern with which
I had returned from the villa, and drove back with
blows my faithful dog who had attempted to follow
me as usual, lest his bark might alarm the servants.
It was a calm, still night—not a whisper was heard
among the trees, nor the movement of any living
thing among the bushes which skirted the garden-path
down which I passed, with beating heart, towards
the tank. It was situated in a hollow at the bottom
of the garden, and in a place well fitted for
concealment, being embosomed in trees, and surrounded
by a thick hedge in order to shade the
water from the sun, so that, even in the heat of
summer, the air always struck damp and chill to
any one coming to it from the broad sunlit alleys
of the garden.</p>

<p>“‘At the end of the narrow path, so narrow
that even two persons could not walk in it abreast,
a flight of stone steps, always wet and slippery,
reached to the edge of the reservoir, which, at certain
seasons of the year, was extremely deep and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
dangerous. I stood upon the steps, and endeavoured
to penetrate the darkness, but I could discern
nothing, save here and there the reflection in
the water of some faint vapoury star, struggling to
disperse the cloud which hung before it. I stooped
and ran my hand along the stone. Cesario was
already there—the branch of alder was laid where
he had mentioned in his letter. I called in low
whispers, ‘Are you here, Cesario?’ There was no
answer—not a sound, save, just at the very moment,
and almost as if in reply, the low, melancholy
howling of the dog whom I had repulsed on leaving
the château, and who had remained watching
at the door! I walked round stealthily to the
gate by which my brother must have entered—perhaps
I should find him awaiting me there.
But no, the gate was open—he <em>must</em> be in the
garden. Again did I call, and again, and still the
same silence, and so I fancied that he must have
arrived early, and, tired of tarrying in the same
spot, was wandering through the grounds, but
would most assuredly return to the place where he
had appointed me to meet him. I sat down on
the steps of the reservoir, consoled with this reflection,
and waited on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
“‘Once or twice I fancied I heard footsteps
approaching, and then I rose and paced in the
direction whence I fancied the sound came. Then
would I again call upon Cesario—again to meet
with disappointment, and to sink once more upon
the cold stone, in a paroxysm of anguish and impatience.
By degrees, however, my ear became
accustomed to the silence, and my eye to the utter
darkness; and it happened with me then, as it
has often done with others—my faculties became
fatigued with watching and with listening, and I
bent my head upon my knees, and fell into an unquiet
slumber. I know not how long I remained
thus, but when I awoke it was already dawn—the
cold grey early dawn which precedes the rising
of the sun. The birds were already twittering and
chattering in the branches above my head, and old
Volpe, the hound, whom I had beaten back on the
night preceding, apparently set free by the opening
of the door, was thrusting his cold nose into
my hand, to attract my attention. I patted him
kindly—he looked up into my face with an expression
I shall never forget, and howled so very
piteously that the sound thrilled to my very soul.</p>

<p>“‘I rose from my seat—every limb was paralysed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
with cold—every joint stiffened by the
uneasy posture which I had maintained so long.
I walked to and fro for an instant, in order to dissipate
the sensation of misery which I experienced,
and reflected with vexation on the situation in
which I had been compelled to pass the night. I
could not help accusing Cesario of negligence and
want of feeling, in thus leaving me to watch and
wait in uncertainty for so many hours. I was
about to move from the spot, when I know not
what instinct prompted me to gaze around the
place once more. I even looked over the hedge
into the tank, and the dog ran hurriedly down the
steps and stood at the bottom, whining in that
sorrowful, uneasy tone, which expresses a sense of
misery and danger with more power than any
human language. I was attracted by the peculiar
steadiness with which the animal stood looking
towards the opposite side of the tank, and mechanically
I suffered my gaze to wander in the
same direction.</p>

<p>“‘Suddenly the beating of my heart was stilled,
my very respiration checked, and the cold perspiration
oozed in large drops from my forehead, as
though I had been standing beneath the heat of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
burning sun! There, beneath the leaden light of
the misty dawn, I could distinctly see a human
form lying at the water’s-edge, still and motionless;
the face was concealed, turned downwards from
the light; but I <em>knew</em> that it was my brother, and
with a shriek of agony I sprang forward to the
spot, with frantic excitement tearing through the
bushes which impeded my path. Before I had
touched the body, I knew that life must be extinct.
Not for a single moment did I labour under the
puerile delusion so common to people in the like
situation, but at once felt the certitude that my
brother lay dead before me!</p>

<p>“‘Death is at all times a ghastly spectacle, but
there are hours and seasons wherein its presence
inspires far less horror than at others; the bed of
sickness—the darkened room—the lighted tapers—the
priest murmuring consolation to the lingering
soul—these are the natural attendants on death,
and soften the disgust and dread that we feel at its
approach. But here, in the full light of the rising
dawn, the birds carolling amid the branches—the
distant song of the merry vintagers who were
already busy at their labours on the opposite hill—all
seemed to jar upon the feelings, and to inspire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
a supernatural horror, from which I am not free
even now when thinking of that hour. I raised
my brother in my arms. He had fallen forward
from the bank, for his head was in the water,
which circumstance I thought at first might have
caused suffocation. The bank was steep and slippery,
likely to have given way beneath his feet,
and he must have been thus precipitated into the
water, whence he could not extricate himself without
help. This was my first impression, but, as I
raised that lifeless form to the light, I perceived
a deep and ghastly wound in his side, from which
the blood had flowed, not freely, but in a thick,
turbid pool, and, as it were, drop by drop! The
knife with which the deed was done lay by his side
upon the grass. I recognised it as his own—my
father’s gift to him when a boy—the very knife he
must have used to cut the branch from the alder,
as the signal of his arrival in the garden. Cesario
had died thus, this miserable death, while I had
been the whole night within sight of his dying
struggles—within hearing of his dying groan, and
yet had seen, had heard nothing—and when tired
of cursing his tardiness, had sat me down and <em>slept</em>
almost within arm’s length of his bleeding corpse!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
“‘The event caused the greatest consternation
throughout the whole country. We were much beloved,
for my father’s sake, and every inquiry was
set on foot which could lead to a discovery of
the means by which Cesario had met his death.
But every measure proved fruitless, and I was
forced to console myself with the opinion of Giordoni,
who expressed a conviction that my brother,
giving way to the melancholy which so long had
preyed upon his mind, had committed suicide.
The letter I had received seemed to many, by its
tone of mystery, to betray symptoms of the excitement
which usually precedes the execution of such
a deed. Cesario was the first person buried in
the new chapel of Saint Ignatius, Giordoni generously
consenting to give absolution for his crime,
and to attribute its commission to insanity.</p>

<p>“‘As my destiny had begun, so did it proceed.
The whole of my property was given up to the Order.
I had been led on, step by step, by the hope of
meeting with my reward—the hand of Isabella—she
who had prevailed upon me to concede every
point to Giordoni, by promises of eternal love. In
the hopes she had held out, consisted now my only
happiness, for I had no longer a future of my own.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Of the flourishing fortune which my father left me,
I was permitted to claim but the share which fell
to me as one of the meanest members of the
“Society.”</p>

<p>“‘Even then I did not despair—for how could
I imagine that I was to be deceived? How can I
tell you all that followed—how the illusions, one by
one, dropped from my vision, and left me as I am—without
faith, without belief either in God or
man!</p>

<p>“‘I had for some time observed a change in
Isabella—an embarrassment for which she herself,
when taxed with it by me, would account by attributing
it to the perpetual disputes and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tracasseries</i>
which she had to endure with her father, concerning
her attachment to me. The old count had long
since forbidden all intercourse between us, but we
had kept up an active correspondence, and obtained
frequent interviews together by means of the Abbé
Giordoni, and I was therefore justified in believing
in her truth. Judge, then, of my despair, when
told that the contessa, weary of the struggle she had
to endure in her own home on my account, had resolved
to retire to a convent, with the determination
never to see or correspond with me until her father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
should consent to our union! She well knew that
this condition was equivalent to a total rupture. I
had given up everything for her sake, and she now
deserted me!</p>

<p>“‘You, my friends, have both of you passed
through the ordeal of passion, and can best judge of
the storm of hate and rage which this conviction
raised within my bosom—how in my bitterness I
forswore her love, and cursed her very name! It
was then that Giordoni came to my aid with his
specious arguments and eloquent reasonings. He
pointed out to me the utter nothingness of human
love, and persuaded me to turn my energies into
another channel, and, by taking priest’s orders, to
seek forgetfulness of my wrongs in satisfied ambition.</p>

<p>“‘I was now, as I have told you, without resource,
a blighted and a disappointed man; his
proposition suited well with the state of feeling
which I experienced at the time, and I accepted it
without hesitation. I was actuated, in taking this
step, by a sentiment of revenge, and was glad to
prove to the faithless Isabella that I relied no longer
on her <em>promises</em>—that I reckoned no longer on her
love. You know how well and how truly I fulfilled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
my office—how ardently I strove in the cause of
the Jesuits—and how at Lyons I succeeded in my
mission—and when the dauphin called me to be his
counsellor and director, how indefatigably I strove
to avert the evil day, which I felt was dawning for
the “Society.”</p>

<p>“‘I worked in earnest, and spared neither toil
nor anxiety in the fulfilment of my task. I might
have persisted to this day, had it not been for a
circumstance which changed the whole end and
aim of my existence. I had not been long an inmate
of Saint Cloud, when I received, from Turin, a
packet from my agent, the man whom I had chosen
to manage the estate when I was about to depart,
to fly from the influence of Giordoni. He had
written to me when at the point of death, and the
torments of his conscience had instigated him to
make a full confession of the deceptions of which
I had been the victim, and in which he had been
assisted by Giordoni. The Order of Jesus had long
coveted the estate belonging to the Cerutti. The
abbé had undertaken to acquire it. My unhappy
brother, being of a religious turn, had fallen an
easy victim.</p>

<p>“‘Once a member of the order, his task was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
betray every word and action which passed in our
family, to act as spy upon every proceeding in his
father’s house, it was his remorse at the part he
was compelled to play, which had caused the bitter
melancholy that had so distressed me in former
years. He had been commissioned to draw me to
the villa V——. This he had resisted, well knowing
to what end I was to be attracted thither. My
own desire had, however, served his vow of blind
obedience; but, as he had proved himself a weak
servant, he was dismissed in disgrace, and despatched
to another station. The agent was chosen in his
stead, and well did he execute his foul task. Not a
look, not a thought of ours but what was written
down and conveyed to Giordoni; not a letter but
was opened, not a message but was reported. As
you have seen, I fell an easy prey to the cunning
of the Jesuit—the falsehood of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Jesuitess</i>. The
man, in his confession, went on to relate, with
tears of repentance, he said, that he himself had
stabbed Cesario, by “higher command.” He had
read the letter before delivering it to me, and the
person “in command” had feared that our meeting
would have marred all.</p>

<p>“‘There was no further revelation; the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the person “in command” was withheld, but hypocritical
still, even at the dying hour, the fellow
ended abruptly by calling on me to offer up my
prayers for the repose of his eternal soul. <em>My</em>
prayers! he has my everlasting curses even in his
grave.’</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand told me that Cerutti had
grown so excited while relating the latter portion
of his history, that the two friends desired him to
desist, and to leave the recital till another time. It
appears that, even with this dread secret on his
mind, further misery was yet in reserve for Cerutti.</p>

<p>“The Order of Jesus was tottering to its basis.
Agents of the Society filled every court in Europe,
in spite of the contumely cast upon them, most
especially in France; yet was it there that they were
most active in their manœuvres. By a fatality,
which, however, will not appear singular when we
remember the talent which she had already displayed,
and the high position she held in the
Order—it was the Contessa Isabella de V——,
now become Marquise de F——t, who was deputed
to Saint Cloud, which had become the head-quarters
of Jesuitical intrigue. There was no witness
to the first interview which took place between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Cerutti and his faithless love; but they say that
the scene must have been terrific, for he was carried
from the apartment to his bed in a senseless
state, and remained for months paralysed in every
limb. He never recovered from the shock which
this event had given to his constitution. Twenty
years afterwards, when intimate with Mirabeau and
Talleyrand, he could not mention the name of the
Marquise de F——t, without betraying every
symptom of the most powerful emotion, and would
confess that, even amid the excitement of the stirring
events in which he had been called to take a
part, her image was never absent from his mind.</p>

<p>“There is little doubt that, had circumstances
taken their natural course, she would have regained
as great an influence as she had before possessed.
It is certain that, during the proscription of the
nobility, <em>her</em> safety alone caused anxiety to Cerutti,
and even at his latest hour, her name was hovering
on his lips. The death of Cerutti was severely felt
by the republicans, who hesitated not to attribute
to him a greater share of talent than even that
possessed by Mirabeau; and I have heard M. de
Talleyrand frequently declare that the plan of every
speech pronounced by the latter was submitted to
Cerutti before it was uttered in the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
“The attachment of the two friends was ardent
and sincere, proof against calumny, and firm in
spite of jealous intrigue. Chosen to pronounce
the funeral oration of Mirabeau, Cerutti burst into
tears as he concluded, declaring that he should not
long survive the loss he had sustained. His prediction
was fulfilled. In less than a year from
that very day, he himself descended to the tomb,
and M. de Talleyrand alone remained of that all-powerful
trio, whose efforts, combined, would have
given another turn to the destinies of Europe.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SALONS OF PARIS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“With Cerutti, Mirabeau, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Feuille Villageoise</i>,
began for Talleyrand a new era, a fresh
existence, outwardly, at least, for, after all, it was
but the realization of the splendid dreams with
which he had solaced his young ambition ever
since that memorable day on which he had changed
the dark blue broad cloth and bright buttons of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">joyeux collegien</i> for the black serge soutane of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">séminariste</i>. I have often heard him declare,
in his moments of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">épanchement</i>, that, during the
years of hardship and trial which followed the first
brief triumph of the new ideas, while toiling for
existence in America, or struggling to keep up a
precarious position in Hamburg, he never once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
looked back with regret upon the splendour of his
life as Bishop of Autun, surrounded by luxury
and grandeur; he never murmured at the loss of
wealth, the change of station; but what he should
lament to the latest hour of existence is the decay
of that <em>society</em> in which he had been bred, which
was lost in ’89 never to return, and which he, perhaps,
by his peculiar tone of mind, was fitted more
than any other man to enjoy. The events of ’89
divided his life into two epochs, so distinct, so far
distant from each other, that it often seems to him,
when looking back upon the past, that he has
realized the old fable, and indeed lived and
breathed during two separate periods, and enjoyed
two lives, with all their individual hopes and fears,
their several joys and sorrows, the triumphs and
defeats peculiar to each.</p>

<p>“I have been much struck with some few observations
of his upon the charm of the intellectual
existence which he had enjoyed before the
breaking up of the old system; he scarcely ever
reverts to the Revolution without bestowing a regret
upon the moral intercourse which it destroyed.
He was even then sadly aware that the great
changes he desired so much must of necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
bring others which he dreaded even more. Even
then he was sometimes led to doubt whether the
good which had been gained could ever compensate
for that which had been forfeited. So impressed
was he with this idea, that he was like the
traveller, who, having arrived at the summit of the
mountain, up whose flowery path he has been
climbing so gaily, turns back to throw one wistful
glance upon the country which he has left behind,
with a sad presentiment that he shall not behold
the like again. When he is in good humour at
Valençay, he loves to linger in memory on that
time, and I have known him remain whole days,
and even weeks, absorbed in the past, disdaining
the present, as unworthy of a good man’s interest
or a wise man’s concern. It is then that his conversation
is most interesting; and, after having
spent a few hours in listening to those anecdotes
which with him seem to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couler de source</i>, one
might almost be led to fancy that one has been
holding communion with the dead.</p>

<p>“I remember, on one occasion, to have felt a
chill come over me upon hearing him begin an
anecdote in these words. ‘I was one evening at
Madame de Boissière’s, when who should enter but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Madame Geoffrin’—Why, the very name is sufficient
to bring back the whole of the eighteenth
century, with its strange mixture of elegant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">badinage</i>
and fierce philosophy, its motley crowd of
rude encyclopedists and elegant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marquis à talons
rouges</i>!</p>

<p>“Talleyrand had the good fortune to enter the
world of fashion under the very best auspices. It
was at the house of the Marquis de Brignolé, one
Saturday evening in the year 1772, that he made
his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">début</i> on leaving the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">séminaire</i>. It was a
memorable event in his life, of quite as great importance
as any of those which have succeeded it,
and he felt far more emotion upon this occasion
than he did when, some thirty years later, he
stepped forward to receive the key of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand chambellan</i>,
or the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portefeuille</i> of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">affaires étrangères</i>.
Can you not fancy him as he entered that
old aristocratic saloon in his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit collet</i>? (the
coquettish distinction, now gone by, of the candidate
for clerical honours.) He was a remarkably
handsome youth, and his fresh complexion and
long golden hair must have appeared to great advantage
among the crowd of withered <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savans</i> in
powdered wigs, with which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> was already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
filled. To hear him relate the adventures of this
his first <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soirée</i> is like reading a page torn from
some old memoir, and can seldom fail to inspire a
feeling of interest almost akin to awe in the mind
of the listener. He tells a story, too, with peculiar
gusto, and seems to grow young again in the
memory of the circumstances which marked his
first appearance in society.</p>

<p>“Madame de Brignolé was one of the most
witty clever women at that time in Paris, and
held a peculiar position in society, from having
had the address to shake off the trammels of caste
and clique, and to avow herself the admirer of all
that was admirable, whether it proceeded from this
set or from that, from the daring <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">philosophe</i> or
shrinking <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vrai-croyant</i>. She had thus succeeded
in gathering together in harmony and good-will
elements the most discordant in themselves, and
which could be made to amalgamate nowhere
save beneath her roof—Madame du Deffand and
Madame Geoffrin, Voltaire and Jean Jacques.</p>

<p>“All agreed to consider her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> as neutral
ground, and to accept at her hands the flag of truce,
which she held out to each with so much grace and
affability. It happened that the reception wherein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the young Abbé de Perigord made his first appearance
was a particularly brilliant one, owing to the
return of Baron Holbach, after a long absence
from Paris. It was on this occasion that he made
the acquaintance of the Chevalier de Boufflers,
one of the leaders of fashion of the day, a specimen
of the elegant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roué</i>, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gredin de bonne
compagnie</i>, who still maintained much of the power
they had acquired. Their friendship commenced
with a quarrel, and lasted through every change of
circumstance until the death of Boufflers, which
happened during the Restoration in 1815.</p>

<p>“It would delight you to hear the prince relate
this story. He laughs even now at the boyish
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">espièglerie</i>, although expressing great contrition
for the horrible pun which passion and circumstance
wrung from him in the heat of the moment.
It was his first, and he says it was his last also,
although its great success might certainly have
warranted many a repetition of the attempt. The
young abbé had ensconced himself in a vacant
seat, quite aloof from the rest of the company,
being bent on observing all that passed, and caring
not for a share in the conversation. He had not
long been seated in this place when he was accosted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
by Philidor, the renowned chess-player,
who, like himself, was a man of few words, and of
most modest and retiring habits. He was an old
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">habitué</i> of the house, and therefore a valuable
neighbour for our young novice, and they soon
fell into close and friendly conversation. D’Alembert
was there, and Diderot, and many other of
the bright particular stars of the day, and Philidor,
with good-natured attention, pointed them out to
the abbé, much diverted with the great interest the
latter seemed to take in each illustrious individual,
who swept past him on his way to lay his homage
at the feet of the lady of the house. They had
been some time conversing thus, when their retirement
was invaded by two young officers, the
one an hussar, the other belonging to the regiment
of Royal Cravatte, poor Marie Antoinette’s
favourite regiment, and the most insolent and saucy
one in the whole service. They were evidently
very deep in the enjoyment of some good story,
for they were speaking low and laughing heartily.</p>

<p>“‘Let us get a seat down yonder against the
wall,’ said the one to the other, ‘and I will tell you
the rest of the joke. I should not like it to be
overheard.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
“‘But I see no room,’ replied his companion;
‘there is Philidor down there talking to some
unfledged blackbird from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">séminaire</i>.’</p>

<p>“‘No matter, we must have the place. Philidor
will soon yield, and the abbé cannot hold out
against us.’</p>

<p>“They advanced straight to where Philidor and
his companion were seated, and, with an insolence
which can hardly be understood in our day, but
which it appears was quite the mark of high birth
and fashion at that time, began to annoy, by their
loud talking and rude behaviour, the occupants of
the two seats which they coveted. Poor Philidor,
whose meekness and patience were proverbial,
soon became alarmed, and sounded a retreat at
once without parley. He rose, with a frightened
look at the abbé, and, remarking that the room was
so insupportably hot that he was stifled, walked away
on tip-toe, not even daring to cast a glance behind.
The Chevalier de Boufflers, one of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garnemens</i>, immediately seized the vacated chair,
and sat upon it soldier-fashion, astride upon the
seat, with his chin resting on the back, staring
with effrontery at the young abbé, who, nothing
daunted, remained quietly in the same position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
that he had maintained during the whole evening.
He had overheard every word of the conversation
which had passed between the two friends as they
approached, and was determined not to move an
inch. The Royal Cravatte stood beside the hussar,
and the abbé was thus completely hemmed in,
save on the side next the door, through which it
was the evident intention of the two friends to
make him soon vanish. Finding, however, their
intention completely defeated by the cool manner
with which it was received, the Royal Cravatte lost
patience, and asked the abbé, with a sneer, if the
heat of the place did not incommode him, at the
same time advising him, with condescending kindness,
to seek the refreshing coolness of the second
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, as his friend had already done at their approach.
But the abbé answered with a bland
politeness peculiar to his manner even then, thanking
the officer for his attention, but assuring him
that, being of a rather chilly nature, he preferred
remaining in the warmer apartment. Royal Cravatte
thereupon grew angry; he was a Cadet de
Montigny, not long arrived from Normandy, and
had not yet lost his miserable Norman drawl.</p>

<p>“‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dites donc, mon cher abbé</i>,’ said he. ‘Perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
as you are just born, you may not yet have
been to school; you have yet to learn many things,
Monsieur l’Abbé, among which—’ ‘Pardon me,’
interrupted the abbé, starting up, with heightened
colour and with flashing eye, and mimicking the
lengthened nasal twang of the officer, ‘I <em>have</em> been
to school, and have learnt my letters, and know
that an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">abbé</i> (A B) is not made to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">céder</i> (C D),
and ’tis not your <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">épée</i> (E P) can make me <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ôter</i>
(O T).’</p>

<p>“The loud voice and insolent gesture of the
officer had caused a little knot of the assembled
guests to gather round, and this sally was received
with roars of laughter. Boufflers, who never could
resist pleasantry, seemed more diverted than any
one present; and, while the discomfited Royal
Cravatte slunk among the company, unable to bear
the mockery which the witty retort of the abbé had
brought upon him, Boufflers shook him heartily by
the hand, and applauded the jest with right good
will.</p>

<p>“This is the very first <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon-mot</i> of the prince
upon record, and although he expresses himself
heartily ashamed of its perpetration, yet it was the
means of establishing his reputation as a person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
not to be slighted, one with whom it would be necessary
to reckon before venturing on pleasantry. The
story, of course, went round the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, to the infinite
delight of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savans</i>, who were enchanted at
witnessing the military insolence of the Royal
Cravatte receive a check from a quarter whence it
would have been so little expected. Rumour of
the witticism soon reached the ears of Madame du
Deffand, who instantly requested that the young
abbé might be presented to her. It was the Chevalier
de Boufflers himself who undertook the
office, and, with a fluttering heart, young Talleyrand
walked across the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, and accosted the
venerable lady, whose great fame for making reputations
had reached even to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">séminaire</i> from
which he had just escaped. It was an awful moment
of his life, and he describes it as one of the
greatest emotion he has ever experienced.</p>

<p>“Madame du Deffand was at that time the
oracle of the witty circles of Paris; her verdict was
sufficient at once to make or mar the reputation of
a man of wit; and it cannot be wondered at, therefore,
if our young <em>séminariste</em> approached with
reverence the high fauteuil in which the lady sat,
as it were enthroned, presiding over the assembly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
with undisputed sway, nor if the whole scene
should have produced an impression upon his memory
which time has not even yet been powerful
enough to efface. Madame du Deffand was surrounded
by a select circle of her chosen friends,
the favourite few whom she honoured with especial
notice; and in the midst there stood, beside her
chair, a low stool, reserved for those with whom
she wished to hold more private converse than
could possibly be enjoyed with any member of the
circle. It was to this seat that the Chevalier de
Boufflers led the young Abbé de Perigord, who
thus in a moment found himself the object of
curiosity and criticism to the whole collection of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beaux-esprits</i>, who served as a kind of body-guard
to their queen elect. The abbé was, however, at
the moment, but little occupied with the effect
which he might produce upon the company; his
attention was entirely absorbed by Madame du
Deffand herself; and if he <em>did</em> experience a slight
nervous agitation as he took his seat beside her, it
was in dread of her all-powerful verdict alone.</p>

<p>“It was almost impossible to imagine a countenance
of greater benignity than that of Madame
du Deffand; she was a complete specimen, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
in person and costume, of venerable beauty; and
as the abbé gazed upon her, he <em>felt</em> that there was
no longer ridicule in the platonic love of Horace
Walpole, or in the enthusiastic passion of her later
admirers. She had been, as you are aware, totally
blind for many years, and this infirmity, instead of
being a disfigurement, as might be imagined,
seemed to increase the mild placidity of her features
almost to beatitude. At the moment of young
Talleyrand’s approach, she was still under the influence
of the delight which his boyish retort had
inspired, and, as soon as he was seated, she bade
him recount the story, which he was fain to do,
and, aided by her encouragement and the applause
of the circle, he told it with so much <em>verve</em> and
good-humour, that his success was complete. He
was welcomed among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coterie</i> as a kindred
spirit, and from that hour was considered an acquisition
to that choice ‘circle.’ He was thus
thrown at once into the midst of the society of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gens-de-lettres</i> of that epoch, the most brilliant
ever registered in the annals of the world. The
schoolboy pun of Talleyrand is forgotten now—lost
amid the more sterling wit of the many <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon-mots</i>
and trite aphorisms to which he has given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
utterance, and which have become popular in every
country. Not so the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïve</i> exclamation of Madame
du Deffand upon the occasion, when she learned the
fright and sudden retreat of Philidor. ‘That man
was born a <em>fool</em>,’ said she; ‘nothing but his <em>genius</em>
saves him!’</p>

<p>“It is by the multiplicity of anecdotes of this
nature that the prince has the power of conveying
the listener, at a single bound, back to the
eighteenth century. The absence of all passion,
or, what is more probable, the great command he
has acquired over it, gives a greater interest to his
recitals than any I have ever experienced while
reading the best written memoirs. I have heard
from another quarter of the judgment of the
prince’s character pronounced by the blind woman
on that very same evening, and which, if true,
ought to stamp her fame as a physiognomist beyond
compare. After having passed her hand
slowly over the features of the young abbé, as was
her wont when any stranger was presented to her
notice, she exclaimed, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allez, jeune homme.</i>
Nature has been lavish of her gifts, and your own
foresight will render you independent of those of
fortune.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
“The immense variety of pictures like the foregoing,
which the prince can command at will from
the storehouse of his memory, is almost incredible.
No one seems to have understood so well as himself
that stupendous epoch, the latter half of the
eighteenth century, that glorious reign of intellect
and reason, when, for the first time in the history
of society, genius and talent were admitted to
greater consideration than high birth or riches;
when every passion—the love of pleasure—the
love of power—even the love of the marvellous—had
given place to the love of <em>truth</em>—sometimes
the greatest of all marvels; when the old aristocracy,
tottering with decay, seemed to call in
weak and puny accents upon its robust successor,
the aristocracy of letters, for succour in its hour of
need, ‘Help us, or we perish!’ and was answered
sturdily, ‘Be of us; or look to yourselves;’ when
the high-born and the long-descended sought no
more to <em>honour</em> with patronage, but to <em>flatter</em> by
imitation, those whom their ancestors would have
deemed of scarcely more importance than their
lacqueys; when, to be admitted to the circle of
Madame Geoffrin, or the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuners</i> of the Abbé
Morellet, was a distinction more eagerly sought for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
than the admission into the royal circles had been
during the preceding reign.</p>

<p>“This short pause before the revolution, which
might be compared to the breathing time allowed
to combatants, or rather to the cold shiver which
precedes the raging fever, has been described by
the prince as the most intoxicating period of his
life. In this unprecedented mixture of society, he
was viewed with favour by each and all. Whether
as the nobleman of aristocratic descent, or the man
of wit and talent, he was admitted into every
circle, and perhaps was thus singular in his perfect
acquaintance with them all. He, who has
so little enthusiasm in his character, will sometimes
grow quite enthusiastic when speaking of that
time; and I have heard him exclaim with melancholy
pride, ‘Could I, by forfeiting the memory
of that brief space of light and glory, add thrice
the number of years so spent to my existence <em>now</em>,
I would not do it. I hold too dear even the privilege
which I possess of exclaiming with Ovid,
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vidi tantùm</i>,” and often mourn those days in the
very words of old Brantôme: “Nothing is left of
all that wit and gallantry, that vast expenditure
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">folle dépense</i>) of bravery and chivalry. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
good remains to <em>me</em> of all this pomp? None—save
<em>that I have seen it</em>!”’</p>

<p>“The greatest of all the regrets expressed by
the prince is for the art of conversation, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’art de
causer</i>,’ which, he declares, never flourished in
any country save France, and has been lost even
there ever since the revolution. He himself is
perhaps the only individual left to tell us in what
that ‘art’ consisted. Like every gift of the Muses,
it seemed to shun the circles of the great, and to
flourish best where reigned equality. The réunions
of Madame Necker in Paris, when her husband
was minister, were always stiff and embarrassed;
her charming <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuners</i> at St. Ouen, where all
state and ceremony were laid aside, will be for
ever celebrated in the annals of letters. The
proper cultivation of the ‘art of conversation’ was
dependent on the union of many circumstances,
and success could not be relied on even by those
who appeared in every way best qualified for the
attempt. None could tell why it was that some
succeeded thus while others failed—why the same
wit which shone so brightly in one <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> was dull
and frigid in another. D’Alembert declared that
<em>he</em> could find conversation but in one single <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
in Paris, that of Madame Suard, the wife of the
celebrated translator and commentator of Hume
and Robertson, of whom Boufflers said to M. de
Talleyrand one day, ‘<em>She is the only pretty woman
of my acquaintance with whom I have never
been in love; and yet she is the woman I love
best on earth</em>.’ A more delicate compliment to
virtue than this was, perhaps, never paid. Diderot
was most animated in the house of Madame
Helvetius, and nursed his powers for her reception-days.</p>

<p>“Madame Geoffrin herself presided over her
own <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> after the death of Fontenelle, who, for
many years, deaf, purblind, and almost centenary,
had thrown such lustre on her meetings, that
foreigners of rank, and wealth, and talent, had
crowded to Paris merely to be presented there;
and such was the charm of the society into which
they found themselves ushered, that many of them
renounced their country to enjoy it without molestation.
Buffon, who in ordinary intercourse was
vulgar in the extreme (so at least says M. de Talleyrand,
who knew him well), became sublime at
Moulin-Joli, where Watelet the painter had the
good luck to assemble all the wit and talent of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
capital. Here it was that Buffon one day grew inspired,
and recited whole chapters of his work
without missing a single word, much to the astonishment
of many of the strangers there, who
thought that it was all improvisation. These intellectual
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soirées</i> of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roture</i> had succeeded in the
guidance and government of ‘conversation’ to the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petits soupers</i> of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ancien régime</i>, but differed
from them, inasmuch as the intellect alone was fed.
The principle of equality had gone so far, that it
was agreed among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">literati</i> to avoid the tables
of the rich, lest he who gave a good dinner should
feel a right to direct the conversation.</p>

<p>“At most of these literary meetings, therefore,
no set repast was to be found; the refreshments
provided were but scanty and of the simplest kind.
One single cup of coffee for each guest at Madame
Suard’s, one single glass of punch (sometimes prepared
by Franklin, though) at Madame Helvetius’s,
formed the whole of the <em>menu</em>. Sobriety was
considered indispensable to the clearness and
steadiness of debate, and the intellect remained
unthickened by eating and drinking. The Abbé
Morellet alone had chosen to add music and feasting
to the attraction of the conversation held at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
his house, and had done so with success. But the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuners</i> were exquisite, although slight. ‘<em>Eat a
little and of little</em>’ was the abbé’s recommendation
to his guests, and the music, that of Glück,
was presided over by himself and executed by
Mellico. The first representation of ‘Orphée’
took place at one of these <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuners</i>, the <em>romance</em>
of which had such an effect on Rousseau, that he
almost fainted on hearing it, declaring that ‘It was
music never to be heard at all, or listened to for
ever.’</p>

<p>“There was but little jealousy at these different
réunions; each came prepared to contribute to the
general amusement, and to listen to the contributions
of others. Every one was openly criticised
and honestly applauded according to his merit.
The barren fecundity of Parny could find admirers
as well as the noble poetry of Delille.
There was scarcely, indeed, a distinction of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coterie</i>,
so nicely were the elements of this society blended.
The only dissidence which existed was between
Madame Geoffrin and the Abbé Morellet, in consequence
of the preference of Jean Jacques Rousseau
for the house of the latter. Madame Geoffrin
had sought by every means in her power to conciliate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the good-will and favour of Jean Jacques,
but she was too fond of patronage. And to all her
advances he had answered, in his surly language,
‘that he hated both benefits and benefactors.’</p>

<p>“The well-known <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mot piquant</i> of Madame
Geoffrin upon the abbé’s guests, which she declared
were composed of ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trompeurs</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trompés</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trompettes</i>,’ amply revenged her disappointment,
but widened the breach between the rival camps.</p>

<p>“‘The chief delight of the abbé’s réunions,’ says
M. de Talleyrand, ‘was the perfect equality which
reigned there. The terror of any encroachment
or assumption of superiority was so great, that
Madame Suard, on being accused of allowing
D’Alembert to act as <em>president</em> of the society gathered
at her house, by placing him on a higher
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fauteuil</i> than those occupied by the other guests,
was obliged to <em>apologize</em> for so doing, and to plead
the ill health and weakened digestion of the philosopher,
which compelled him to remain continually
in an almost upright position.’</p>

<p>“‘Good Heavens! what a quantity of pattens!’
exclaimed, in a sneering tone, M. de Creutz, the
Swedish ambassador, as he entered the ante-room
at Madame du Deffand’s, where Madame Necker
had undertaken to present him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
“‘So much the better,’ answered the lady, ‘they
give us promise of good company.’</p>

<p>“It was in the frank reception of talent, no
matter whence it emanated, wherein lay the secret
charm of these <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">conversaziones</i>. No individual was
excluded as a matter of course, none admitted as
a matter of right.</p>

<p>“I remember being once much delighted with
an argument which took place upon this very subject
between the prince and one of the best writers
of our own day, who has since risen to greatness
and power by the assistance of his pen alone. The
latter maintained that a greater knowledge of mankind
was to be obtained by the study of well-written
books, than could be acquired even by personal
experience. The prince, in reply, gave utterance to
some of the most beautiful and original thoughts
which I have ever heard him express.</p>

<p>“‘Tell me not of books,’ said he, good-humouredly,
‘they never can contain the <em>natural</em> impressions
of the writer. They can express neither surprise
nor fear—the very anger which they convey has
been all premeditated. Tell me not of books—they
are “composed” by men, and are even greater
hypocrites than they. The history of every age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
would be found with far greater truth in the history
of its conversations (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">causeries</i>) than in the most
brilliant of its literary productions. Few men write,
all converse; authors have copied each other both
in style and sentiment ever since the world began,
but the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">causeur</i> is himself, and speaks as he feels
and thinks. The old axiom, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">verba volant</i>, is a
great evil, but the addition to the proverb, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">scripta
manent</i>, is a greater still. You, who are preparing
to write the history of one of the greatest struggles
which ever took place in the annals of the universe,
would do well to study the history of the conversations
of the generations preceding; you will find
there the preconception of many an event which
falsely seems to have occurred spontaneously, and
which overwhelms us with wonder at its apparent
rashness. Even Louis Quatorze, whose Bastille
yawned so greedily for those who dared to <em>write</em> a
syllable against the justice of his measures, was
known to wince beneath the lash of the witty
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">causeurs</i> of his day; he felt that he was powerless
against their attacks, and was compelled to flatter and
to pardon, as Richelieu, that greater tyrant still, had
been forced to do before him. He was too clever
to affect to despise their ridicule, and trembled,
lest resenting it might expose him to further stings.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
“‘These witlings are as troublesome as summer-flies,’
said the magnificent monarch one day to
Colbert, who had reported to him an epigram which
he had heard in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> of Madame Cornuel.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sire, <em>and just as unconquerable</em>,’ replied
Colbert.</p>

<p>“‘To which remark the greatest sovereign of the
world could only answer with a sigh of mortified
conviction. Not a privilege was granted during
the reign, not a decree was passed, which had not
first been debated in the circles of fashion, with as
much bitterness and energy as it afterwards created
in the royal council chamber. The memoirs of
the time, the letters of Madame de Sevigné, bear
ample evidence of this. The regent who succeeded,
was himself of a spirit too near akin to
the intrepid <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">causeurs</i> of his reign to visit them
with severity. He laughed with them and at them,
while his harshness to those writers who displeased
him was even greater than that of his predecessor.
Louis Quinze encouraged not the persecution of
authors, but loved to listen to the daily report of
the “conversations” which took place, not only
among the court circles, but even down to those of
the lowest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>. Madame de Pompadour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
complains bitterly, in one of her letters, of this extraordinary
apathy concerning the libels which
were published both against herself and him. “He
cares not for what is written, only for what is said,”
exclaimed she, “as if any consideration could
restrain the tongues of ungrateful courtiers.”</p>

<p>“‘The author of the gross epigram upon
Marshal Saxe was suffered to go scot-free, while
the poor parrot who recited it at Madame de la
Vaillière’s for the amusement of the company, was
punished with the Bastille for life. Now compare
all these <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">causeries</i> and their results to the <em>conversations</em>
of the eighteenth century, and their gigantic
issue—the great revolution. The displacing of a
minister—the puerile questions of religious form—the
end and aim of Télémaque—these were the
kind of questions which had formed the subjects of
debate during the reign of Louis Quatorze. The
acrimony with which they were discussed, and the
genius and passion which were displayed in the
disputes to which they gave rise, sometimes went
far enough to alarm the throne, without creating
the slightest interest in the minds of the people.</p>

<p>“‘How different the consequences of that single
remark, made in the midst of a gay and laughing
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coterie</i>, soon after the accession of Louis Seize,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
when everything promised security and happiness,
prosperity within and peace without, when not a
single indication of the distant tempest had as yet
appeared; and the old nobleman asked, in jeering
pleasantry, of his son, who was speaking of the
power of the law—“And pray, young man, will
you tell me what <em>is</em> the law?” and was answered
by the young man with sudden inspiration, “The
law is the expression of the general will!” The
axiom has since been repeated to satiety, and has
formed the text and basis of the grandest arguments
of the revolutionary orators, but few know
that it was first pronounced in the manner I have
described. I found the whole account of this
“conversation” in a letter among my uncle’s papers,
in which the writer, who was present when it occurred,
gives also the description of the high disputes
which the remark created, after the first
moment of silence with which it was received—the
silence of conviction in the young, the silence of
disapproval in the old—had passed away. This
maxim, which, dropped thus at random, buried
like the acorn, not forgotten, and which brought
forth such goodly fruit in its due time and season,
is another proof of the tremendous power of our
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soi-disant</i> “gay and frivolous” <span class="smcap smaller">CONVERSATION</span>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>’”</p>

GRANDT—PRINCESS TALLEYRAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On the morning after the conversation on the art
of conversing, which I have just transcribed, I happened
to find myself for some little time alone with
C. in the prince’s dressing-room. I had been summoned
to the sanctum by M. de Talleyrand himself,
who had received letters from England by that day’s
post, in answering which my English might, he
thought, be turned to account. I had obeyed the
message with the greatest pleasure, as C. had already
informed me that admission to his boudoir at the
hour of his toilet was an honour sought by many,
and accorded but to few. In this exclusion he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
most rigid, and he reserved the admission as a
<em>distinction</em>, refusing to yield it as a right even to
his most intimate friends. It was perhaps well that
he did so, for, by a singular inconsistency, he who
has been so often reproached with prudence and
caution, was at this moment unguarded and unsuspicious
as a child. As I had, according to the
etiquette of the place, forestalled by some little time
the precise moment fixed by the prince for our
rendezvous, I profited by the vacant time to examine
attentively the furniture and ornaments of this
favourite retreat of the diplomatist, wherein perhaps
the peace or discord of European states had been
at various times planned and promoted.</p>

<p>It was a light and cheerful apartment, looking
out into the fosses surrounding the château, which,
at that season of the year, were all gay with verdure
and flowering shrubs; then far away the view extended
over the park, at the end of which the dark
forest encircles the landscape with a belt of sombre
hue, and shuts out the distant horizon. The room
contained but little furniture, and that all of the
antique cast, in use at the time of the Empire, hard
and angular, stiff and naked. The large leathern
chair for the prince, which stood in the centre of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the room beside an old-fashioned dressing-table,
upon which were already spread the divers utensils
for his approaching toilet, although giving my
<em>English</em> prejudices a slight <em>inquietude</em>, yet awoke
certain pleasurable reminiscences of the court of
Louis Seize and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">toilette du matin</i> of the beaux
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">muscadins</i> of ’89. Near these stood a mahogany
bureau, upon which his secretary wrote
while the prince dictated the correspondence even
amid the elaborate manœuvres of two valets-de-chambre,
which kept him for the moment in a state
of discomfort and subjection.</p>

<p>The walls were hung round with portraits. C.
told me that they were, without exception, those of
<em>friends</em>, and I examined the collection with the
greatest interest. They were arranged without any
attempt at order, neither by age nor date, merely
according to the shape of the frame, and the size of
the panel, and it was curious to observe the confusion
to which such an arrangement had given rise;
Alexander the autocrat and Mirabeau the democrat
hung side by side, while Fréron and Voltaire
gazed at each other with that peculiar smirk which
has been so happily denominated the “painter’s
smile.” I was struck with the vast number of female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
portraits, of all ages and denominations, which met
the eye; there was a beautiful crayon drawing of
Madame de Genlis with her harp, and another of
Madame de Staël with her book and pencil, and a
full-length painting of Madame Roland hung opposite
to one of Madame de Lamballe. I glanced
over the collection with most intense interest; it
was the romantic chapter of the life of M. de Talleyrand,
one with which diplomacy and politics had
nought to do. “How I should love you to tell me
the history of the individuals whose representations
are assembled here,” said I to C., who was
watching me as I walked leisurely round; “what
admirable illustrations to your ‘Vie Anecdotique’
they would furnish!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” returned my friend, “the ‘Vie
Anecdotique’ would scarcely be complete without
them. As I have already told you, M. de
Talleyrand, from his earliest youth, has relied
upon the support and patronage of women.
There is scarcely one of these ladies who has not
played some part in the advancement of his fortune.
You might follow the epochs of his life by
the title and social position of his patronesses. You
smile; but it is even so. No <em>English</em> mind can ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
be made to comprehend the sort of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">liaison</i> which
sometimes exists between persons of different sex in
France. It is of every kind of friendship the most
pure and disinterested; <em>love</em> is seldom generated by
these attachments; that sentiment would on the
one side tend to mar the devotion, and on the other,
render the feeling liable to the changes and chances
of caprice. I could call to mind numberless examples
of this species of allegiance, which, having
begun in youth, have continued unto old age with
the same confidence, the same self-sacrifice. Come
hither; you will find an apt illustration of my
meaning.”</p>

<p>He led me to a portrait placed in the shadow of
the chimney. “This was the first friend of M. de
Talleyrand, when he was a youth just let loose from
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">séminaire</i>, and she whom this picture represents
was a woman already advancing to maturity. Surely
we cannot suspect the existence of love <em>there</em>. This
lady, whose name was so long associated with every
early success of the prince, when he was still Abbé
de Perigord, was the celebrated Comtesse de
Brionne, the mother of the unfortunate Princess de
Lamballe, and grandmother of the present King of
Sardinia. She was the first to distinguish the merit
of the young abbé, and by her influence to maintain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
him in his position in spite of the dislike manifested
towards him by the court of Marie Antoinette.
Even lately I heard him speak of her in terms of
intense gratitude and affection; and his voice,
usually so deep and grave, faltered as he recounted
to me the story of her death. She was among the
first emigrants after the breaking out of the revolution,
and retired to the Austrian dominions, having,
by permission of the emperor, assumed the title of
Princess of Lorraine. There she lived in poverty
and obscurity for some years, resisting every effort
made by M. de Talleyrand to obtain forgiveness
for what she deemed his <em>crime</em> in having deserted
his caste and renounced his profession, to adopt the
principles of the revolution.</p>

<p>“Among the little circle of devoted friends who
had gathered round her in her exile, the conduct
of M. de Talleyrand was frequently the subject of
conversation, and she has been heard to declare
that his defalcation had given her more pain than
many sorrows which ought to have touched her
more nearly. In the year 1805, when M. de Talleyrand,
then in the zenith of his favour with
Napoleon, accompanied the latter on his famous
tour of ‘mediation’ into Austria, he repaired to the
little town of Linz, where the princess had chosen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
her retreat, expressly to obtain an interview, with
the hope of soothing her into forgetfulness of his
errors. The letter which he despatched from the
inn where he alighted, was a model of grace and
politeness. He had recalled in its composition all
the half-forgotten traditions of courtesy and high
breeding which he had learned in her school. He
had flattered her by every expression of gratitude
for former favours, appealed to the memory of
bygone days, and announced his intention of personally
waiting upon her for the answer on the
morning following, unless he received a summons
to appear before her that same evening.</p>

<p>“No answer came that night, and accordingly,
about twelve on the day following, the prince set
forth from the little inn where he had alighted, to
gain the small château, situated a short league from
the town, where the princess resided, full of doubt,
and already somewhat disappointed at not having
received, in reply to his letter, even so much as a
cold permission to present himself before her. He
had attired himself in a costume which should
recall to her mind as much as possible the period
of their first acquaintance, having carefully laid
aside every token of the rank which he held at the
court of the usurper, resolving that nothing in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
person or demeanour should shock the taste and
feelings of his friend. He has often owned to me
that his heart beat with such violence as he drew
near the château which the guide pointed out to
him as that occupied by the princess, that he felt
half inclined to turn back, and to leave his errand
unaccomplished until he had received some token
of the oblivion of his errors, which he had been at
so much pains to seek.</p>

<p>“At length, the carriage stopped before the gate
of a ruinous-looking building, which stood on the
brow of the hill outside the town. M. de Talleyrand
alighted, and walked up to the iron gate which
looked into the forecourt, for he thought it might
appear more discreet and in better taste to avoid
every semblance of state and ceremony. He wished
to bring to her mind the Abbé de Perigord alone,
and hoped she might forget what he had become
since then. The whole place wore a wild and
desolate aspect, and the silence alarmed him. Not
a soul was stirring about the premises, and what
was still more extraordinary, was the circumstance
of the shutters being all closed, although it was
bright noon-day.</p>

<p>“He pulled the bell with a violent effort, and it
sent forth that hollow, melancholy sound which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
so peculiar to a deserted building. The summons
was answered by an old portress, who hobbled to
the gate with lagging pace, and eyes red and
swollen with weeping, while, close at her heels, followed
the old dog, whom he recognised on the instant
as old Vaillant, who used to run so joyously
down the steps of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i> to meet him when he
entered the courtyard of the hotel of Madame de
Brionne in Paris. But the animal knew him no
longer, for he barked and growled with savage fury
at every token of recognition, and the woman only
sobbed the louder in answer to his inquiries.</p>

<p>“‘The princess was <em>gone</em>!’ she said. ‘She had
departed but a few hours before. She had left the
château with all her retinue, and she feared that
her highness would never return!’ M. de Talleyrand
has described the pang of that moment as
being one of the most bitter that he has ever experienced
throughout his whole life; and he remained
for an instant silent from emotion. The
woman drew from her pocket a letter which she
said was to be delivered to the gentleman who had
written from Linz on the evening before, and who
was to call for the answer. The prince took it in
silence, not daring even to gaze upon its contents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
until alone. He re-entered the carriage,
and drove towards the town, and it was not until
the château was lost to sight, and the barking of
old Vaillant was heard no more, that he mustered
courage sufficient to break the seal and open the
envelope.</p>

<p>“It contained nought but his own letter—not a
word, not a syllable in explanation. He turned to
the superscription, and then no longer felt astonishment.
It was addressed to the ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Prince de Benevent,
Ministre de Napoleon, Empereur des Français</i>.’
Every word was underlined; the meaning
was clear. Such a person was unknown to the
Princesse de Lorraine! In spite of her advanced
age and feeble health—in spite of the assurance of
protection which Napoleon had vouchsafed to her
on his approach, she had fled from the place
rather than meet him who had deceived all her
hopes, and fallen so low (to use her own expression)
as ‘to serve as footstool to enable the
usurper to sit more at his ease upon the throne of
the Bourbons.’ She returned no more to Linz
even after the departure of Napoleon, but fixed
her residence at Presburg; and when M. de Talleyrand
repaired to Vienna to assist at the famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Congress of 1814, his friendship made him forget
his former repulse, and once more did he solicit
more humbly, more passionately than before, for
pardon and reconciliation. This time the appeal
was not in vain; he had returned to the good and
righteous cause; he had once more re-entered the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voie sacrée</i>, and she answered him in her own
hand, and by return of courier, bidding him use
all despatch, as ‘the moments now were numbered.’</p>

<p>“No sooner did the missive reach him, than he
set out from Vienna without a moment’s delay,
travelling night and day, until he reached Presburg.
It was just at the grey peep of dawn when
he traversed the streets of that ancient city, but yet
he resolved to drive at once, prompted by one of
those singular presentiments to which through life
he has always listened, to the old palace which the
princess now inhabited.</p>

<p>“How different was his reception from that
he had experienced at Linz! Even at this early
hour, servants were standing round the gate;
and as soon as his carriage, with the broad
rattling wheels and jingling bells, had turned
the corner of the street, the gates were thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
open wide, and the carriage entered at once,
without impediment. It was evident that he had
been expected with impatience, for he was received
in silence, as if there had been no time to waste
in idle greeting. The old servants whom he remembered
did not speak out their welcome, but
merely bowed in acknowledgment of his kindly
recognition, and hurried him without announcement
and without ceremony to the chamber of
their mistress.</p>

<p>“It was not until he stood upon the threshold of
that silent chamber and viewed the scene within,
that the truth flashed upon his mind—then the reason
of the expectation and the silent greeting, of the
haste in which he had been ushered into her presence,
became evident at once, and he tottered
forward to the bed, and fell upon his knees by the
side of the priest, whose muttered prayer filled the
room with a low mysterious murmur. Madame de
Brionne was dying; her eyes were already closed,
and her fingers were already relaxing their grasp
of the rosary which lay outside the bed. It seemed
as if the repose of death had already stolen over
her, when suddenly, as if a supernatural instinct
had warned her of the entrance of M. de Talleyrand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
she started up, and gazed at him fixedly;
then said, with a sweet, sad smile of affection, as
she stretched forth her hand towards him, ‘Ah,
Monsieur de Perigord, <em>you alone</em> can tell how
dearly I have loved you!’ She sighed deeply,
sank back upon the pillow, and before his lips had
ceased their pressure upon her outstretched hand,
it lay powerless and dead within his own! She
had died while the words of tenderness with which
she had greeted him were yet upon her lips, and
while that smile of recognition yet lingered on her
placid countenance. And when M. de Talleyrand
rose from that bedside, her form was already
straightened beneath the coverlet; the tapers were
already lighted round the bed, and the sheet was
thrown over her face, concealing it from view, so
that he beheld it no more!</p>

<p>“I have always considered this event as one of
the most touching episodes in M. de Talleyrand’s
life. I have heard him speak of Madame de
Brionne in terms of the highest veneration, as a
woman of the most exalted virtue, and one of the
grandest souls he had ever met with, well fitted by
nature to be that which fortune had made her—the
sister and mother of kings and princes—and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
is, perhaps, a little remorse mingled with the regret
with which he laments the loss of her society during
so many years. Her advice had guided and sustained
his youth; it might, perhaps, have aided
him in his maturer age; and, while he was at the
height of his power and influence during the empire,
he has often surprised, in his own mind, a
slight feeling of uneasiness respecting the sentiment
with which Madame de Brionne would peruse
the journals wherein his name was mentioned in
connexion with that of the emperor. I think that the
tie which bound him to Madame de Brionne must
have been the only one by which he suffered his
soul to be held captive. In other cases, he withstood
the influence; in this one alone did he submit
to it, perhaps, in fact, scarcely conscious of
his slavery.</p>

<p>“The next link in these voluntary bonds was that
woven by beauty and talent combined. Young
as he was, he was already too old to be captivated
by wit <em>alone</em>. The <em>liaison</em> to which I now refer
has made much noise in the world, and were I
attempting to represent the prince, not as he really
is, but as I should wish to find him, I might gloss
over the one spot of this kind which has darkened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
his career, or endeavour to wipe off the reproach
which he has incurred; but I will give you the
facts as they really were, leaving you to make your
own comments.</p>

<p>“It would appear that, contrary to the usual
theory, the fascination entered neither by the eye
nor by the ear; it was the result of fanatical admiration
of his great powers of mind. This lady was
married, at the age of fifteen, to the Count de
Flahaut, who was fifty-eight. With the steady, uncompromising
morality of your English principles,
you will, perhaps, be startled at the coolness with
which I mention this; but surely there is some excuse
in this unjustifiable union, and the unstability
of principle at the time, and it is unfair to separate
crime and error from the institutions from which
they have arisen. It was not till after the death of
her husband, who perished on the scaffold in ’92,
that she became acquainted with M. de Talleyrand,
having been in active correspondence with him
during the whole period of his exile, and having
saved him, by her timely information of the state
of feelings and parties in Paris, from acting with
precipitation, and from yielding to the treacherous
invitations of false friends, who advised his return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
to certain destruction. He had received, for many
months, regular intimation of all that was passing
in the capital. At first he had paid but small
attention to these anonymous epistles, but, by
degrees, as he beheld the realization of all the previsions
put forth by the unknown writer, he took
confidence, and resolved to abide by the counsels
expressed in the mysterious letters, and so blindly
did he rely upon the correctness of the information
contained therein, that, being twice upon the point
of re-crossing the channel, he twice deferred the
step in obedience to the advice of his anonymous
friend, and each time had cause of rejoicing that
he had thus acted.</p>

<p>“Madame Champion, at that time, like himself,
an exile in London, was his only confidante in this
affair, and to her alone did he communicate his
embarrassment touching the author of the correspondence.
I have spoken to you before about the
singular fatality which has sometimes attended
upon the steps of M. de Talleyrand, and which
must be attributable to his surprising memory and
great powers of observation. In this instance did
he once more experience its influence, and by its
aid alone, I have often heard him declare, did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
he discover the name and station of his benefactor.</p>

<p>“He had one day been speaking with Madame
Champion upon the subject, and in his perplexity
was enumerating the relations whose affection could
be likely thus to render them vigilant and clear-sighted;
she had called over successively every
degree of relationship—aunt, uncle, cousin, brother.
But to every new suggestion, M. de Talleyrand
discovered some well-founded objection, until, at
last, Madame Champion cried, laughingly, ‘Well,
it is evident, then, you have, as in the good old
fairy tales, some wise and powerful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Marraine</i>.’
M. de Talleyrand shook his head. ‘Alas, Madame,
neither <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Marraine</i> nor <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Filleul</i>,’ returned he, quoting
from Beaumarchais’s ‘Figaro,’ and the subject
dropped.</p>

<p>“It was soon after this that the unknown friend
advised his return to Paris, and, as he had hitherto
found benefit in following the counsels thus conveyed,
he hesitated not in this instance. Upon
his arrival in the capital, he found everything in
the state in which he had been led to expect
it, and his greeting was such as to make him rejoice
that he had not lingered in the execution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the step suggested by his well-wisher. After this,
he was indefatigable in his researches. He kept
the adventure no secret, but told it in every circle
he frequented; hoping thereby to obtain some clue
to the discovery of his benefactor. He felt sure
that the letters were written by a female, not from
the handwriting, nor from any peculiar refinement
of style, but from the singular mixture of boldness
and timidity which was evident in every line. The
deep interest expressed for his safety, and yet the
kind of awkward fear lest this interest should be
exaggerated in the mind of the reader; in short,
whether it was that the conviction of M. de Talleyrand
led him to believe that such disinterested sentiment
could emanate from none but a woman, I
know not, but it is certain that never did his suspicion
light on an individual of the other sex, while,
from the very moment of his return to Paris, did he
begin to look around among the women of his acquaintance,
and to fix suspicion upon each, until
further research displayed the futility of his surmises.</p>

<p>“He had already been for some time at Paris
without being able to obtain a clue whereby to
form any probable conjectures upon the subject,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
when, one evening, being by chance at a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soirée</i>
given by Barras, his attention was attracted to a
young lady whom he had at first observed with that
languid indifference with which one is too apt to
survey a stranger, where there is nothing in particular
to arrest the attention. M. de Talleyrand
had been standing, half hid by a curtain, in a recess
of one of the windows, talking to Count Réal, and
the lady had left her seat at the further end of
the room, to take one close beside him. He had
paid but slight attention to this circumstance, and
after the departure of Réal, went to join the group
of talkers assembled in the doorway.</p>

<p>“He had not been here many moments, before
he observed the same pale lady in deep
black move stealthily from the place which she
had occupied, and where she had been listening
with glistening eyes and heaving bosom to the
various questions of interest which he had been
debating, and again seat herself close to his side.
M. de Talleyrand, struck with the pertinacity with
which she seemed to follow his movements, was
naturally led to examine her with more attention.
She was of small stature, and delicate in feature,
with eyes of most peculiar lustre, and the sable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
weeds in which she was attired added to the interest
inspired by her youth and pallid countenance.
‘Who is that lady?’ asked M. de Talleyrand, abruptly,
of the person with whom he was conversing.
The lady blushed deep as scarlet. It was evident
that she had heard the question. ‘She is the
widow of the Count de Flahaut,’ was the reply;
but it conveyed no association to the memory of
M. de Talleyrand, and he shook his head, endeavouring
to recall to mind the name at the old court,
when suddenly his informant continued, ‘You
surely must remember her marriage? It is not so
very long ago. She was a Demoiselle <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Filleul</i>, a
name of no importance—second-rate provincial
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hobereaux</i>.’</p>

<p>“The word acted like magic upon the whole
nervous system of M. de Talleyrand. By some unaccountable
chain of thought, the laughing observation
of Madame Champion recurred to his mind,
and he inquired more fully concerning the lady.
Everything he heard tended to confirm the idea
which had so strangely taken possession of his mind
with regard to her identity with his unknown protector.
His first step, of course, was to get himself
presented to her. And how could he, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
tact and observation, fail to perceive the strong
emotion visible in her manner of acknowledging
his attentions, and the faltering, unsteady voice in
which she answered his seemingly careless, though
strictly polite address? He steadfastly avoided,
however, in this first interview, any allusion to his
journey to London or to his return—he was fearful
of creating embarrassment—fearful of exciting
alarm or suspicion of his real motive for seeking
her acquaintance, and he was aware of the necessity
for prudence and discretion. He despatched
a note the next morning to inquire at what hour
he might be permitted to present himself at the
lady’s house. This was done designedly.</p>

<p>“The handwriting of the few lines of cold politeness
which he received in answer, confirmed at
once the bold hope he had entertained; and he
hurried to the appointment, with what feelings of
tenderness and gratitude may well be imagined.
In all the conversations which I have held with
him upon the subject, he has never been led into
betraying the particulars of this interview—no one
can tell how he first broke to the lady the discovery
he had made, nor how she received his
warm and trembling thanks; but from that hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
her spirit had found its master, and bowed to his
own, held captive and enslaved.</p>

<p>“The faith and devotion of the fair young
countess, were never belied through the long years
of trial and vicissitude which followed, and instances
are recorded of her risking hopes of fame
and fortune, nay, her very life itself, to aid the
prince in the struggle against destiny which he had
so bravely undertaken. She twice made the journey
to England alone, without protection, going round
by way of Holland, to serve him; and when, by
the sale of her first novel in England, she had
realized a small sum of money, it was shared with
him, who, she declared to the latest hour of her
life, had more right to it than she herself, for he it
was who had caused her to exercise the talent
which Heaven had bestowed, and the existence of
which she would never have known had it not been
for the taste and cultivation which he had imparted.</p>

<p>“Their double marriage was a double error,
which has never been satisfactorily accounted for,
and which must remain a secret. In the case of
the lady it brought rank and affluence, but neither
ease of mind nor happiness, while in that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
prince, which <em>followed</em> soon after, the consequences
were humiliation and disappointment.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said I, “you must surely have something
to tell me concerning the marriage of the
prince? That is one of the greatest events of his
life, and one which has puzzled his biographers
more than his most ambiguous proceedings.”</p>

<p>“The world has been unjust to Madame de
Talleyrand,” replied C. “I knew her for many
years, and she was far from being the fool which it
has pleased the public to consider her. M. de
Talleyrand himself, amid all his good-humoured
quotations of her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bêtise</i>, or absence of mind, cannot
help pausing to commend the great tact and
admirable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de conduite</i> which made her,
during those years when he was in high office
under Napoleon’s government, an invaluable aid
and ally by the manner in which she practised
that most difficult art, so highly prized by the
French, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’art de tenir son salon</i>. This, to a man
of M. de Talleyrand’s tastes, might be of much
more importance than the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mots</i> of Madame de
Staël, or the stately dignity of Madame Recamier.
Look at yonder portrait by the side of the window,
and you can judge of the beauty which had power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
to fascinate a man so <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">difficile</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasé</i> as M. de
Talleyrand.”</p>

<p>C. drew aside the blue silk curtain which
shaded the casement, in order to throw a full light
upon the picture of which he spoke, and I was
positively startled at the heavenly beauty of the
countenance thus disclosed. It was indeed lovely,
and I felt at once that no further explanation was
necessary to account for the step which had excited
so much astonishment and so much condemnation.</p>

<p>“However, many reasons did exist more worthy
both of M. de Talleyrand himself and of the object
of his choice; and in spite of all that has gone abroad
respecting his caprice, I have ever found that those
who had known her longest, loved her most.
I have myself heard M. de Talleyrand recount the
story of their first meeting, which he did with most
exquisite relish, smacking strongly of the good old
times of Lauzun and Richelieu, and not a whit the
less amusing for all that. It was one of the most
memorable evenings in the whole private life of
Monsieur de Talleyrand. He had been attending
the debates of the Manège, and, harassed and
wearied with the vast farrago of nonsense which he
had heard poured forth for so many hours, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
returning home with the intention of going early to
bed, when, in the middle of the street, his arm was
seized by one of his old associates, the Chevalier
de Fénélon, who, according to custom, was hurrying
to the faro-table, and who pressed M. de Talleyrand
to join him, declaring that he had spent the
day in combinations and calculations to ensure
winning, and that he was convinced that if he could
only put them to the proof that very night, he was
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en veine</i> to break every faro bank in Paris. It
needed but little persuasion perhaps to induce M.
de Talleyrand, in the frame of mind in which he
then was, to yield to the temptation, and he followed
the chevalier with no feeling save that of
curiosity, never intending to play himself that night,
but to act merely as spectator of the wondrous success
of his companion. The house chosen by the
latter as theatre of his anticipated exploits was the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tripot</i> in the Palais Royal, known even then as the
famous ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cent Treize</i>.’</p>

<p>“Fénélon, whose reliance on his own resources
was proverbial, seated himself at the long roulette
table with perfect ease and confidence, while M.
de Talleyrand, who knew the deplorable state of
his friend’s finances at the time, stood behind him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
trembling for his fate, and watching with anxiety
every roll of the balls, every slide of the shovel.
One—two—three passes had been played, however,
and the chevalier, according to his own anticipation,
won on, consulting at each call from the
croupier the slip of paper which he held in his
hand, and upon which were scrawled his calculations
concerning the chances of the game. This success
did not at first attract any extraordinary attention.
Examples of luck in the outset were but too common;
but when hit after hit was made, and still
the chance remained the same, whispers began to
float around the table that all was not fair and
as it should be. The chevalier heeded not the
effect that his extraordinary run of luck had produced,
but continued in silence to sweep the gold
into a heap before him, regarding perhaps with
an undue share of that malicious enjoyment in
which it was his wont to indulge, the astonishment
and discomfiture of his opponents.</p>

<p>“It was evident that this state of things could
not last long; the murmurs of the players, the
manifest terror of the bankers, were beginning to
disturb the game, when presently one of the croupiers
came between the friends, and with pale and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
trembling lips whispered in the ear of the winner a
few words which made him start. A warm conversation,
still in the same mysterious whisper, was
for a few moments carried on between them; and
finally, after various signs of supplication on the
part of the croupier, and of doubt and hesitation
on the part of the chevalier, it was announced to
the assembled players that M. de Fénélon would
retire from the contest upon payment of the sum
still left in the bank, which could be subscribed
among them, and thus diminish the loss to each so
as to be scarcely felt by any.</p>

<p>“This singular proposition, unheard of in the
annals of the gaming-table, was received with the
most profound indignation and astonishment on the
part of the losers, but Fénélon himself undertook
to prove that they could not lose, but must be the
gainers, as his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reine</i> would most assuredly break
the bank at the next roll of the balls. After some
few uncouth exclamations on the part of the gentlemen,
and a little pouting on the part of the
ladies, the matter was carried. Fénélon was ‘paid
off’ by a subscription, and dismissed with many a
muttered curse from the honest and reputable
assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
“Upon leaving the gaming-house, the chevalier’s
joy became uproarious, and he trod the silent
streets, reeling with laughter at the whimsical trick
which Dame Fortune had condescended to play
him. He chinked the gold in his pockets until it
rang again, and made his companion dread lest
the sound should be overheard by any of those
nocturnal marauders with whom the streets of Paris
at that time abounded. He even threw a handful
of the coin down the grating of a cellar, for the
sake of wondering what the occupants of the
miserable hole would think of such good luck when
they should awake the next morning. M. de Talleyrand,
who never could endure any kind of midnight
brawling, was right glad when they had
reached the residence of his friend, and wished him
good night with hearty good-will, content to be rid
of his uncouth laughter and joyless gaiety.</p>

<p>“But Fénélon was not at all disposed to acquiesce
in his friend’s desire for rest and quiet.
The excess of good fortune had wrought the same
effect as an excess of wine. He was as much excited
as though he had been drinking the whole
night; and when it came to the parting at his own
door, he would not hear of M. de Talleyrand’s returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
without recruiting his strength for the
remainder of his walk by a libation in honour of
the propitious fates. Had it been daylight, he
would have immediately laid out the whole of his
winnings in some wild and fanciful gala to his
friends. M. de Talleyrand needed some little
pressing to enter. He was tired and sleepy; giddy,
too, with the noise and rattle of his companion, and
longed to be at home and to be at rest. However,
there was no resistance possible, and before he could
even form an excuse for retiring, he found himself
comfortably seated in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roué’s</i> own private sanctum,
whither few of his sex, and certainly none of
his calling, had ever penetrated before. Champagne
was now called for; the rouleaux were displayed
in piles upon the table; every taper in the
girandoles was lighted; a roaring fire was soon
kindled on the hearth; the clock on the mantelpiece,
which marked two, was stopped by a jerk
from the chevalier’s finger; and the cards were
brought from the drawer of a book-case in the
corner of the chimney.</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand was but little prepared for
the excitement of cards; the very sight of them
was sickening, after the long hours spent at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tripot</i>, and he at once declined the game, expressing
his intention of withdrawing without
further delay, as he had much business to transact
in the morning. But Fénélon laughed, as well he
might, for none ever escaped who had once fallen
into his clutches, and he filled the glasses with
champagne, all the while sorting and dealing the
cards for piquet, as if his friend had not uttered a
word; then looked at his game, called out “seven for
a point,” and tossed off a bumper, while he waited
for the answer. This <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang-froid</i> was irresistible.
M. de Talleyrand, although grumbling at his own
fatigue and the lateness of the hour, took up the
cards spread out before him, and was soon interested
in the chances of the game, which seemed
at first to be as much in favour of his adversary, as
they had been already at the Rouge et Noir table.</p>

<p>“‘What are our stakes?’ said Fénélon, presently;
‘it is for you to propose, as the luck seems to be
all mine to-night.’ ‘They must be small, indeed,’
said M. de Talleyrand, drawing out his purse,
which contained but little, and throwing it carelessly
on the table. ‘Done!’ cried the chevalier,
turning its contents out upon the green-cloth.
‘Come, courage; double or quits until morning!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>’
This first trial of skill was in a few moments
decided in his favour, and he swept the contents of
the purse, as he had done the louis-d’ors of the
gaming-house, into his own heap, which seemed
destined to grow monstrous.</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand played on, and grew more
resolute as his adversary grew more ironical and
insolent. He lost his watch; his chain and seals;
the ring which he had saved amid all his embarrassment
and poverty, during his uncertain wanderings
in foreign climes; he lost the very buckles off his
shoes, and the knee-clasps from his inexpressibles,
and at last rose from the table, declaring that he
must now go home, as he had nothing more to lose.
‘Pardon me,’ laughed the chevalier, ‘you have yet
another stake against which I have no objection
to venture this heap of gold, without counting.’
M. de Talleyrand still denied the possession of any
article of value; but the chevalier pointed to his
breast-pin—a long gilt pin surmounted by one of
those scarlet berries with a black spot at the extremity,
which we call <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grains rouges d’Amerique</i>.
M. de Talleyrand objected that the article was not
worth a franc; scarcely, indeed, a few sous. It had
been the gift of a negress at Philadelphia, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
by a singular mistake that he had placed it in his
bosom, instead of the one of great value which he
usually wore. He had changed his dress at twilight,
and, in passing his hand over the toilet-cushion,
had drawn forth the trumpery ornament
which he now displayed, instead of the emerald he
had apparently mislaid when he had changed his
cravat. The circumstance, which had been considered
a freak on his part, had even attracted the
attention of a neighbour at the club, who had
pointed it out to him, and who had been much
amused by the surprise which the discovery had
occasioned.</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand vainly urged the utter worthlessness
of the trinket. The chevalier was in high
glee, and, insisting upon its following the rest of the
spoils, placed it beside the goodly heap of gold
upon the table, chuckling all the while with that
irritating irony which would long before have
dashed into fury any temper less calm than that of
his companion. But M. de Talleyrand laughed
with him, and, as he disengaged the pin from the
plaits of his neckcloth, merely related how that,
having saved the black cook at the house where he
lodged, at Philadelphia, from a severe punishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
she had given him this bauble as a precious remembrance
of her gratitude. It had been charmed
by the Obeah man, she had told him, and was
considered a talisman against evil fortune.</p>

<p>“‘It has not answered to-night, at all events,’
exclaimed the chevalier. ‘The devil’s charm
which <em>you</em> carry is stronger than the Obeah-man’s!’
replied M. de Talleyrand; and they began their
game once more. The cards were this time more
favourable; but Fénélon lost the hard-fought battle
with good grace, and whistled merrily as he cut the
cards to his adversary. How shall I tell you what
followed? It seems so strange a tale, that you will
hesitate to believe it, and yet I give you my honour
that it is true. The first game was won by M. de
Talleyrand—the first during the whole evening,
and it was with a nervous eagerness that he snatched
up his trumpery pin, leaving the gold which the
chevalier had staked to be doubled in the next
hand, for again was Talleyrand the winner. The
tide of fortune had turned. He went on winning,
without intermission, until near daylight, when
the whole of the gold which had been won at the
gaming-house was transferred from the pocket of
the chevalier to that of his friend!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
“M. de Talleyrand had several times requested
leave to depart, but Fénélon had obstinately refused
to allow him to withdraw, so long as there
remained a single louis on the board or a single
trinket in his possession. It was five o’clock when
the adversaries at length rose, M. de Talleyrand,
embarrassed with his success, the chevalier mortified
and crest-fallen, when the latter, with a sudden
inspiration, thumping his fist upon the table, exclaimed,
‘One more trial, and I have done! I
<em>must</em> have that confounded breast-pin! By all
the powers, the Obeah-man was right; it is that
which brings the luck!’</p>

<p>“‘But what have you to stake against a trinket
of so much value?’ returned M. de Talleyrand,
endeavouring to laugh away the impression which,
in spite of himself, the occurrences of the evening
had made upon his mind. ‘Look round the room,’
was the answer, ‘choose any article you like; I feel
sure that this time I shall win it; for it was when
you were at your wit’s end that fortune changed!’</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand looked round the room,
but it was only for form’s sake. He had already
in his own mind chosen his booty. It was
a small silver urn, of antique form and most delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
workmanship. Its weight and value did not
seem very great, neither was it chiselled or adorned
in any manner, but its form was so graceful and
elegant, its proportions so exquisite, that it could
not fail to attract the eye of a connoisseur, and he
named it with less compunction from a knowledge
of the smallness of its intrinsic value. The moment
he mentioned it, however, all the desperate gaiety
of the chevalier seemed to have received a sudden
check. He started, and set down the glass he was
about to raise to his lips, and, looking full and
steadily into the face of his companion, while,
however, his lips quivered slightly, and his voice
was much subdued, he answered, ‘You have fixed
upon the only thing from which I cannot—I dare
not part. I could not risk the loss of that little
vase were all the riches in the universe staked
against it.’</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand was much astonished to find
that there was anything in the world to which
Fénélon attached importance, and rallied him upon
the discovery; but, surprising to say, this jest was
not met by the usual spirited rejoinder. His companion
answered not, but calling for more champagne,
swallowed a tremendous bumper at a single
draught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
“M. de Talleyrand, of course, could offer no
objection to this reasoning, and with a heavy purse
and lightened heart he bade his friend good night,
and left the room. Scarcely, however, had he
reached the outer door of the apartment, when the
valet-de-chambre, who had been fast asleep in the
ante-chamber, came running after him, with a request
from his master that he would return. The
chevalier was standing over the fire, leaning against
the chimney, and clasping the urn, which he had
taken from the book-case where it had reposed,
close to his heart. In an instant, M. de Talleyrand
could perceive that the bottle which he had
left upon the table was now emptied; and, as
Fénélon turned towards him, he was startled at
beholding his discomposed and agitated countenance.
‘I have changed my mind,’ said he;
‘this may be to me what the pin is to you. I have
resolved to try its magic influence against that
which has protected you. Speak not a word—ask
me no question—I shall deem the slightest remark
as a summons to meet you in the <em>Bois de Boulogne</em>,
with witnesses and loaded weapons!’</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand did as he was requested; he
placed his <em>enjeu</em> before him; but he observed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Fénélon grasped the urn with trembling fingers,
until compelled to lose his hold in order to survey
his game. A frightful oath—frightful from the
compressed energy with which it was uttered, flew
from his white lips as he looked at his cards; and,
with the instinct of an experienced gamester, beheld
his fate. By a really extraordinary chance, it
so happened that this time the cards held by M.
de Talleyrand were what he calls <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fabuleuses</i>—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pique</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">repique</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">capot</i> were carried in the one hand,
and the chevalier sat amazed and stupified, not
having been called upon to count a single point.
He rose from the table in desperation, and seized
the urn, which M. de Talleyrand remarked he had
removed from the table with almost religious care
when the game began, and handed it to his friend,
but at arm’s length and with averted gaze. The
prince had not courage to pursue the torture, and
he said, as he waved it back, ‘Do not press me to
accept the trinket, M. de Fénélon. Take it, I beseech
you, as a gift from me; ’twill be but an
earnest of the rest of all I have won of you, for you
are sure to have it back again. You know well
that I always succeed in keeping my winnings just
long enough to make the loss of them more severely
felt.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
“‘No!’ returned the chevalier, fiercely; ‘what
is lost is lost. It is your right to keep the bauble,
and I ask favour of no man. Away with it, then!
To demur in taking up your lawful gains is to give
offence to the loser.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, as you like,’ returned the prince; ‘but
remember, I hold the urn at your disposal should
you alter your determination.’</p>

<p>“He took the vase, and placed it beneath his
coat. The wistful gaze of the chevalier smote him
to the very heart; but, after the fierce manner in
which his attention had been received, he sought
no second rebuke, and was about to depart; when
suddenly, to his great surprise and alarm, the
chevalier rushed forward and tore it from his
grasp, exclaiming, in a tone of the most bitter rage,
‘By the Lord, I am a fool. I played for nought
but the urn. ’Twas the urn alone I lost. You
cannot deny that’—and he cast a furious glance
towards his astonished guest; ‘you said not a word
of the <em>contents</em>. They are mine by every law;
you <em>dare</em> not say ’tis otherwise. I defy you to tell
me that I spoke of its <em>contents</em>.’</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand answered not; he was appalled
at sight of this sudden outburst of fury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
and Fénélon having, with trembling fingers, succeeded
in tearing open the lid which covered the
little vase, and dashed it with a violent effort against
the side of the chimney, a slender column of dark-coloured
ashes, almost impalpable, fell through
the small aperture into the fire, where it blazed
with a small sparkling blue flame for a single
moment, then smouldered into darkness, leaving
behind a strong aromatic odour, which seemed to
hang heavily on the atmosphere of the room, causing
a sensation of sickness and a dimness of the
sight. Even this died away before the chevalier
had ceased gazing at the spot where the substance
had fallen; and M. de Talleyrand, embarrassed
and fearful of giving further offence in
the strange mood in which his companion was,
once more slowly took up the urn and sought the
door. He could not avoid turning back to catch
one last glance of the Chevalier de Fénélon. He
was leaning with his elbows on the mantelpiece
and his forehead buried in his hands. The bright
light from the tapers in the girandoles fell full
upon his countenance and <em>struck upon the tears</em>
which were rolling down his cheeks, causing them
to sparkle and to glisten as they fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
“The prince closed the door noiselessly, and
descended the stairs, full of a solemn wonder at
what he had beheld. He grasped the urn with a
nervous energy beneath his mantle, and with a
trembling dread did he pause beneath the first
lamp which hung suspended above the causeway,
to examine it more closely, inspired by a far different
interest from that with which he had hitherto
beheld it. He turned it again and again to the
light, but could discern no inscription whereby to
gain a clue to guess at its former destination; the
same sickening odour of scented oils and aromatic
spices greeted him from the unclosed aperture, and
it was still heated almost to burning by the careless
manner in which the chevalier had held it to
the fire, when shaking out its mysterious contents.</p>

<p>“He was about to abandon the search, when,
by accident having turned it to replace it in his
bosom, a few letters, traced beneath the pedestal,
met his eye; he lifted it to the light of the lantern,
and read them more distinctly. A few particles
of the same dark dust which Fénélon had
shaken forth, dropped from the vase upon his hand,
and he blew them off with hasty impatience, nor
heeded where they fell. The letters traced upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the silver were in relief. To a stranger they would
have indicated nothing, but to M. de Talleyrand
they were pregnant with a deep and frightful
meaning.</p>

<p class="b1 center">
“<i>C. H.—March 17th.</i><br />
<br />
“<span class="smcap larger">Mercy and Forgiveness!—Miserere!</span>”
</p>

<p>“In an instant, he remembered the story which
had been afloat some time before, and which he
had treated as an old wife’s tale. The beautiful
young Countess H——; her husband’s jealousy—his
violent death by the hand of the chevalier—the
wife’s despair and retirement to the convent at
Louvaine—her subsequent death and legacy to
Fénélon, which had caused such condemnation
and astonishment. ‘Let my body be opened after
death,’ said she, in her will, ‘and let the heart
which has beat but for him be reduced to ashes,
and let it be thus conveyed to him, so that, when
he dies, it may repose within his coffin, for it is his
own.’ She it was who had designed the vase—she
who had chosen the inscription.</p>

<p>“The memory of this event had passed away, and
the salons of Paris had been occupied with other
subjects of more stirring import; but the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
story burst at once, with all its attendant circumstances
of horror, upon the stricken memory of the
prince. The dark stream of ashes and the aromatic
odour—the coincidence of the initials and
the date—and then the tears which had been
wrung even from those eyes burning and bloodshot
with riot and debauchery—it was evident that
the story which had been told, and which he had
doubted when every one else believed, was too
true. He replaced the vase within the folds of
his mantle with a feeling of disgust and hatred
towards the cold-blooded <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roué</i> whose rage for
gaming and excitement had led him to commit this
sacrilegious deed. He inwardly resolved that no
temptation should induce him ever again to associate
with the reckless libertine—a promise, however,
which he was not very long called upon to
keep; for, soon after this adventure, the chevalier
was found one morning dead in his bed, having
swallowed a strong dose of corrosive acid: fit termination
to his wild, unprincipled career.”</p>

<p>“And what became of the silver urn?” said I.</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand, with true delicacy of feeling,
sent it the very next day to the Marquise de Cossé,
an old convent friend of the unfortunate victim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
and she, I believe, took the proper means of restoring
it to the family.”</p>

<p>“And the mysterious pin? Have you ever
seen it?”</p>

<p>“I have,” replied C., laughing aloud; “at least,
when I asked the prince concerning its fate, I was
shewn a long brassy-looking object, from which all
gilding had long ago vanished, and was told that
the magical berry had been lost in his various
peregrinations. ‘Perhaps,’ observed he, ‘it was
stolen by some one who knew its value.’ But as the
remark was accompanied by the peculiar dropping
of the lip and deadening of the eye with which he
usually ventures upon a <em>mystification</em>, I knew well
what to think, and questioned him no more.”</p>

<p>My friend paused after he had concluded this
strange story, and, beginning to fear lest he had
been led away from the original purport of the tale,
I reminded him that he had not yet explained to
me the particulars of that first interview with Madame
Grandt, which had had such a powerful effect
on the destinies of the after-life of the prince.</p>

<p>“It was indeed a fitful night,” said C.; “one of
those wherein the superstitious might easily believe
that the devil is allowed to walk abroad and mingle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
his curse with the vain projects of aspiring man. It
had begun for M. de Talleyrand with a scene of
purgatory—it ended with a vision of heaven.</p>

<p>“He hastened home full of the stormy emotions
of the interview with Fénélon, and the strange and
almost terrific discovery he had made beneath the
lantern in the Rue de Montpensier. He was
harassed and fatigued; and, eager to gain the quiet
and solitude of his own chamber, was hurrying to
repose, when, judge of his annoyance—his servant
informed him that a lady was waiting to receive him
in his study, whose business was of so much importance,
that having called late in the evening
with the hope of finding him at home, she had
preferred awaiting his return, even although it
should not take place until dawn, so great was her
fear of losing the interview she had come so far to
obtain.</p>

<p>“It was thus with more vexation than curiosity that
M. de Talleyrand entered, therefore, the study—where
the stranger, according to the account of the
servant, had already been awaiting him for <em>five</em> long
mortal hours!—without any of the <em>prestige</em> which
had usually accompanied his introduction to a
stranger of the softer sex, perhaps even <em>his</em> calm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
temper a little ruffled at the unseasonable hour
and the unexpected <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corvée</i>.</p>

<p>“The shaded lamp upon the chimney-piece
threw but a dim light around the room, and some few
moments elapsed before he could even perceive the
lady, who was seated in the large arm-chair by the
fire, her figure enveloped in the mantle worn at the
time, wide but not long, reaching only to the knees,
and displaying the gauze and gold tissue of the ball-dress
worn beneath. It was evident that the fair
stranger, exhausted with fatigue and watching, had
fallen into a sleep so sound, that not even the entrance
of M. de Talleyrand, nor his approach, nor
his convenient fit of coughing, had power to rouse
her. A letter addressed to himself lay upon the
table, and he opened it, hoping that the noise which
he made in moving to and fro would awaken her.
It was a letter from Montrond, introducing to his
acquaintance the bearer, Madame Grandt, who
wished to confer with him upon urgent business,
and to seek his advice in an affair concerning which
none but himself could give information.</p>

<p>“The name of Madame Grandt immediately
awakened all the dormant curiosity of M. de Talleyrand,
and he now turned towards the fair stranger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
with a feeling of interest far different from that
which he had experienced on his entrance. He
had heard much of her extraordinary beauty, and
had long desired the opportunity of judging whether
the reputation were well earned. The whole
scene was unique of its kind, and never before had
M. de Talleyrand felt so much embarrassment as
when the servant, after having in vain endeavoured
by every innocent artifice to awaken the lady, left
the room with an ill-suppressed titter at the novelty
of the situation in which his master was placed.
The noise of the door, however, which the cunning
varlet took care to close with as loud a report as
possible, succeeded at last in awaking the fair
stranger, who started to her feet, surprised and
terrified to find herself thus discovered in slumber
by a stranger, whom, however, she instantly knew
to be M. de Talleyrand, from the description which
she had already received of his appearance. The
impression he produced upon her mind, startled
and alarmed as she was at the moment, was one of
awe and veneration, while the effect which she
created in his was that of admiration so intense that
he has called it instantaneous devotion.</p>

<p>“Madame Grandt was at that time in the full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
zenith of her beauty, and of the kind of loveliness
most rare and most admired in France. I have
heard that she was of English origin. This is not
true. Her maiden name was Dayot, and she was
born at l’Orient; but her connexion with India,
where a great part of her family resided, and the
peculiar character of her beauty, would seem to
have been the groundwork of the supposition. She
was tall, and, at that time, slight in person, with
that singular ease and languor in her carriage
which have been considered the peculiar attributes
of the creole ladies. Her features were of that soft
and delicate mould but seldom seen in Europe;
her eyes, large and languishing, were of the deepest
black, while her hair played in curls of brightest
gold upon a forehead of dazzling whiteness, pure
and calm as that of an infant. Throughout her
whole person was spread a singularly childlike
grace, which at once interested the beholder infinitely
more than the sublime beauty which distinguished
her great rivals for the admiration of
the worshippers of fashion at that day, Madame
Tallien and Madame Beauharnais.</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand, who, with remarkable independence
of spirit, talks of the princess without
the slightest prejudice, observed to me, while describing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
this scene, that when she first threw aside
her hood and disclosed to view that lovely countenance,
all blushing with shame and with surprise,
the effect was such that even he, man of the world,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasé</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">désillusioné</i> as he already was, felt himself
completely deprived, for the moment, of his usual
self-possession, and stood before her almost as
abashed as she herself. It was some time, indeed,
before he recovered sufficient self-command
to give utterance to the phrases of politeness
usual on such occasions, and to offer his services
in whatever manner would facilitate the
business concerning which she had sought him at
this hour.</p>

<p>“If he had reason to be astonished, first of all,
at the singular time of night she had chosen for
the execution of her errand, then more astonished
still at sight of her wondrous beauty, most of all
did he own himself astonished when he came to
listen to her description of the purport of her unseasonable
visit. With the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïf</i> credulity which
suited so well with the childlike beauty I have
already remarked, she proceeded to relate to him,
with much trembling and with tears, all the alarm
she had experienced upon hearing the report which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
had been afloat at the assembly at Madame
Hamelin’s, (where she had been spending the
evening,) concerning Buonaparte’s intended invasion
of England, and his promise of delivering
up the Bank to pillage as a reward to his successful
soldiery. So great, indeed, had been her terror at
this news, that she had involuntarily let slip a
secret which she had hitherto most religiously
kept: ‘that, in fact, she had long ago lodged the
greater part of her fortune, and the whole of her
plate and jewels, in this very Bank of England,
which Buonaparte had so generously promised to
abandon to the pillage of his victorious troops as
the reward of their valour.’ This announcement
had been received at the assembly with shouts of
laughter; and again did she burst forth in bitter
weeping when complaining of the cruelty displayed
towards her by such untimely levity.</p>

<p>“So great was the power of her tears, that M.
de Talleyrand began to press more than ever to be
informed in what manner he could be of service in
this matter. She then intimated to him that at sight
of her grief two or three of her tried and valued
friends, foremost of whom stood M. de Montrond,
had recommended to her to hurry immediately to M.
de Talleyrand, for that he alone had power to save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
her property; that, from his situation, he could even
make himself responsible for its safe delivery into
her hands; and for this purpose M. de Montrond
had immediately penned the letter which she had
brought, begging her to fly with it immediately to
his house, and not on any account to leave it until
she had obtained the guarantee.</p>

<p>“Although, of course, highly diverted at the
mystification, and somewhat embarrassed at the
situation in which he found himself, yet M. de
Talleyrand was too gallant to disclose to the fair
lady that she had been the dupe of her own fears
and of Montrond’s insatiable love of practical fun;
and in order to quiet her nerves, he instantly drew
up in due form a security, signed and sealed, for
the safe delivery of her plate and jewels into the
hands of any person she might choose to appoint
to receive them, as soon as ever Buonaparte’s
triumphal army had entered the City of London.
The fair applicant, highly delighted at the
success of her petition, left the house, reading
again and again with confidence the writing he
had given her, and perfectly insensible to all his
gallantry and admiration amid the joy inspired by
his kind proceeding.</p>

<p>“Such is the history of the first interview of M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
de Talleyrand with Madame Grandt. I know it to
be true, for I had it from the lips of the prince
himself, who enters with the keenest relish into the
ridicule of the whole scene, sparing himself as
little as the princess. The mystification was completely
successful. Madame Grandt was fooled to
the top of her bent by the perpetrators, but the
affair had a far different sequel from that which
had been anticipated, for M. de Talleyrand became
most passionately attached to the fair solicitor,
and to the surprise of all Paris, he who had
resisted the refined beauty of Madame Tallien, the
elegance of Madame Recamier, and the wit and
fascination of Madame de Staël, fell an easy victim
to the more plain and unsophisticated graces of
Madame Grandt. It is certain that not one of the
ladies who had laid siege to his heart had managed
to obtain so strong a hold upon his affections or to
keep them so long; and I can only account for
this by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïveté</i> which gave so strong a tinge of
originality to all she said or did, so unlike the
slavery to forms and etiquette which must ever
influence professed ‘women of the world,’ such
as those by whom he was surrounded.</p>

<p>“So much has been said about her ignorance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
and stupidity, that they have passed into a proverb,
while, in reality, she was neither ignorant nor
stupid; but there was certainly an <em>inexperience</em> in
the social traditions of the world into which she
was ushered through the influence of M. de
Talleyrand, which gave rise to much amusement
among the wits who frequented her society. It
would be difficult to account for the strength of
the attachment with which, from the very first, she
inspired the prince. It certainly was the longest
and the strongest that he ever experienced. Various
have been the conjectures respecting the
causes of his marriage, but the story which was
told me by one who was a confidant of the prince
at the time, is, I think, the best calculated to
unravel the mystery which still hangs over it.</p>

<p>“Madame Grandt was, as I have told you, unrivalled
in the tact and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">convenance</i> with which she
received company, dispensing politeness to each
and all alike, contenting every one, and displaying
so much cleverness in her management of the fiery
spirits who frequented her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, that it was impossible
for those who knew her then to deem her
either ignorant or foolish. It was this peculiar
talent which had induced M. de Talleyrand, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
was quick both to perceive any peculiar excellence
and also to turn it to account, to hold his receptions
at her house instead of at his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ministère</i>.
He had already done so for some time without
having been subjected to remarks; for the system
was, alas! too common at the period to excite the
slightest degree either of condemnation or surprise.
Fouché, ever on the watch to injure Talleyrand,
had taken care to apprise the First Consul
of this arrangement. The information, which had
excited no interest at the moment, was not wholly
lost, however; and a short time afterwards, having
been foiled in some of his projects by the policy
of England, he sent for Talleyrand, and, puzzled
to find a subject which he could use as a pretext
for venting his spleen upon his minister, remembered
the tale borne by the enemy Fouché. ‘It is
no wonder that we are abused and vilified by
England,’ said he, showing a paper in which appeared
a scurrilous article upon the First Consul—‘when
we expose ourselves to such attacks as
these, and even our public ministers give public
example of disorder and ill-conduct.’ The minister
looked his inquiry concerning the meaning of this
outburst. ‘Yes,’ continued Buonaparte, waxing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
warm, as was his wont, with his own words, like an
ill-disciplined schoolboy—‘yes, it has reached me
that you hold your receptions at Madame Grandt’s,
and thus the envoys and ambassadors from foreign
courts are compelled to wait upon your mistress.
This must not continue.’ ‘Neither shall it,’ returned
the prince, colouring slightly; ‘they shall
henceforth be spared; they shall wait no longer on
Madame Grandt, but on Madame de Talleyrand;
no longer on my mistress, but my wife.’</p>

<p>“The marriage took place before the following
week’s reception, and it is said that Buonaparte
was so vexed and irritated at his own littleness,
that he even condescended to <em>lie</em> in order to cover
it. ‘What can have caused Talleyrand’s abrupt
and extraordinary marriage?’ said Barras, one
day, soon after the event. ‘My <em>promise</em> to ask
from the Pope “absolution” and the cardinal’s hat
as a reward for his services,’ returned the First
Consul, quickly, and immediately changed the conversation.</p>

<p>“Whatever may have been the conduct of Madame
Grandt, however reprehensible her facility of
morals before her marriage, it cannot be denied
that, from the very hour in which this event took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
place, it became irreproachable. M. de Talleyrand
himself loves to render her every justice on that
score. She was too proud of the name she bore
ever to disgrace it by any action which she would
have deemed unworthy. Like <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parvenus</i> in general,
she grew rather intoxicated when arrived at
the summit of honour, for, as Princesse de Benevent,
her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morgue</i> and insolence at the court of
Napoleon became proverbial, and many amusing
anecdotes are told of her absurd pretensions to
royal privileges, her pages and her maids of honour,
her chamberlain and mistress of the robes.</p>

<p>“I myself once witnessed a curious instance of
that total forgetfulness of the ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jadis</i>,’ which seems
to be the peculiar failing of persons who have
risen from obscurity to rank and fortune. I was
one day descending the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i> of the hotel in the
Rue St. Florentine, when a hackney coach entered
the court-yard and drove up to the vestibule. I
was greatly surprised to behold alighting from it,
fine as court robes and towering plumes could
make her, the Princesse de Benevent herself. I
of course hastened down the steps to offer her my
arm on alighting. ‘My carriage struck against
the lamp-post at the entrance of the Tuileries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>’
said she, in answer to my inquiring look, ‘and the
wheel came off. I was forced to return home in
this absurd looking vehicle.’ Then turning to the
wondering lacqueys, she added, in a tone of disgust
and scorn which no language can describe, as
she pointed to the coachman, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Qu’on paie ce malheureux!</i>’
The mixture of the sublime and ridiculous
in the tone and gesture by which the words
were accompanied, was absolutely irresistible.</p>

<p>“To a mild and conciliating nature like that of
the prince, and above all with his keen sense of the
ludicrous, such a disposition must have been peculiarly
irritating, added to which, Madame’s jealousy
of every member of his family to whom he showed
affection grew too irksome to be endured, and for
their mutual comfort it became advisable to have
separate establishments. But even amid the bitterness
and soreness of feeling to which such an
arrangement cannot fail to give rise in every family
where it unhappily takes place, did the prince,
with true generosity and liberality of sentiment,
endeavour to render justice to her undeviating devotion
to his interests, by making a settlement
even too magnificent in proportion to his income,
more, in fact, than it could comfortably bear. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
frequently saw her after her separation from the
prince. So far from having retained either rancour
or ill-will against him, there was something
touching in the eager interest with which she
listened to the slightest details concerning him.
She spared not questioning, and seemed never
weary of listening to my report of his health and
well-being. Everything in her apartment bore
witness to her constant remembrance of the days
of her happiness and grandeur; the rug before the
fire, the embroidered cushion upon which her feet
were rested, the lawn handkerchief in her hand,
the clock upon the mantelpiece, all bore the impress
of the arms of the Talleyrands, and ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ré que
Diou</i>’ shone forth conspicuously on each; while
even the little cage wherein reposed a couple of
snow-white dormice displayed in its mimic dome
and tower a complete model of the château of
Valençay.</p>

<p>“She told me, with a frankness I little expected,
that she should never cease to regret the life she
led here; she could not even speak of the place
without tears, and questioned me, with great
minuteness, concerning every individual throughout
the province; her memory never failing her in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
the slightest particular with regard to the genealogy
of the different families whose estates lie in the
neighbourhood of the château. Her heart seemed
to yearn towards the prince, and her expressions
of admiration concerning his great talents and
wonderful powers of mind were affecting in their
truthful simplicity. In spite of the want of elevation
of soul, which neither nature nor education
had imparted, I still think that the prince entertained
a real regard for her, and of many a courteous
message from him have I myself been the
bearer, whenever it became known at the hôtel Talleyrand
that she was labouring under the slightest
indisposition. Towards the latter years of her life,
however, her pre-occupation concerning all that
passed in his household became one of the greatest
sources of petty annoyance to which the prince was
subjected. For some time before her death, it
amounted, indeed, to positive mania. She insisted
upon regulating her establishment entirely upon
the model of that of the Rue St. Florentin, ruling
the minutest details of her domestic economy in
imitation of that observed in the prince’s household.
She even subjected her own diet and hours
of taking her repasts to the same system of imitation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
and upon one occasion nearly fell a victim
to her over-strict observance of the prince’s rule of
never taking more than one meal in the day.</p>

<p>“As to the innumerable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïvetés</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coqs-à-l’âne</i>
which have gone forth to the world as hers, you
must not believe one half of them. I think that
many of them were invented under the erroneous
impression that the surest way of annoying M. de
Talleyrand would be to ridicule his wife. It is
certain that many of the blunders which are laid
to her charge bear the unmistakeable stamp of the
firm of Montrond and Co. I once attacked the
prince upon the subject, and was much amused at
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonhomie</i> with which he laughed at the bare
remembrance of all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bêtises</i> which so many wits
had employed themselves in inventing for the poor
princess. I asked him if the story, which has gone
the round of every newspaper in Europe, about
Baron Denon and Robinson Crusoe, were really
true. ‘It did not actually happen,’ replied he,
smiling; ‘the circumstance did not really occur as
it has been represented, <em>for I was there to prevent
it</em>. However, it was <em>guessed at</em>, and that was enough;
the blunder was ascribed to her without compunction.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
“‘I certainly remember a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïveté</i> which she once
uttered in the midst of a circle of savans and literati
at Neuilly, which would be considered quite as
good and become just as popular were it as generally
known. Lemercier had volunteered after
dinner to read us one of his unplayed and unplayable
pieces. The company had gathered round
him in a circle; his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cahier</i> lay already unfolded on
his knees, and, clearing his voice, he began in a
high, shrill tone, which made us all start from our
incipient slumber, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Scène est à Lyons</i>.’ ‘There
now, M. de Talleyrand,’ exclaimed the princess,
jumping from her chair, and advancing towards
me with a gesture of triumph, ‘now I knew that you
were wrong; you would have it that it was the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Saône</i>!’ To describe the embarrassment and consternation
of the company would be impossible.
I myself was perplexed for an instant, but soon
remembered the difference of opinion to which she
had alluded. As our carriage was crossing the
bridge at Lyons, a little time before, she had asked
me the name of the river which flowed beneath.
I had told her it was ‘Saône;’ to which she had
replied, with a truly philosophical reflection—‘Ah,
how strange this difference of pronunciation; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
call it the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Seine</i> in Paris!’ I had been much
amused at the time, but had not thought it worth
while to correct the self-confident error, and thus
had arisen this extraordinary confusion in the
troubled brain of the poor princess. Of course we
all laughed heartily at her unexpected sally; but
we were grateful, nevertheless, for it saved us the
reading of the dreaded drama, as no one that evening
could be expected to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">retrouver son sérieux</i>
sufficiently to listen with becoming attention to
all the terrible events which Lemercier had to
unfold.’</p>

<p>“You see the prince had succeeded in accepting
his misfortune <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en homme d’esprit</i>, and the keenest
shafts of ridicule must have fallen pointless against
one who joined with such hearty good-will in the
mirth which was thus raised, without at all agreeing
with those who deemed that it was excited at
his own expense.”</p>

</div>

<p>Just as my friend had ceased speaking, the door
was opened, and the two valets-de-chambre of the
prince, armed with shaving-pot and powder-puff,
with the same solemn look as at the toilet of Louis
Quatorze, described with such humour by Saint
Simon, entered and took their station one on
each side the doorway; but when the prince himself
entered likewise, in dressing-gown and slippers,
leaning on his cane, and bowing low, with a courteous
“good morrow,” the picture was complete.
Le grand monarque in his old age, Fagon and
Bréville, seemed to arise before me. I have heard
it said that one great test of the temper of a man is
the mood in which he awakes from slumber. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
certainly was true as applied to Prince Talleyrand,
for perhaps at no other moment in the day was he
more lively, more free from care, than at the hour
of his toilet. It seemed as if the dreams of the
past night had brought with them calm and pleasant
recollections, for he was always more disposed
to narrate at that moment than during the rest of
the four-and-twenty hours. He had soon despatched
the business upon which he had summoned
me; but he bade me remain, and I was in no hurry
to depart; for one by one the favoured few dropped
in, and the conversation became interesting enough
to make me behold without regret the hurrying off
to the wood of a joyous caravan which issued from
beneath the gateway with echoes of merriment.</p>

<p>C. had busied himself in turning over the journals,
translating from the various English papers
the leading article of each, and pausing here and
there to extract speeches and opinions most worthy
of notice. I shall never forget that morning—it
was the last opportunity which was afforded me of
judging of the never-failing faculty of that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">conteur
intarissable</i>. The conversation had turned upon
England, and it was in reference to some observation
made in one of the articles which C. had just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
been reading that the prince expressed himself
towards this country with an admiration and gratitude
which I shall never forget.</p>

<p>“It has ever been my dream,” said he, “to behold
a firm and stable alliance between England
and France. I cannot live to behold what I have
yearned for all my life long; but <em>you</em> may yet be
witness to the result to which the events of Europe
have all tended for the last three centuries. There
are many countries, many climes in Europe; there
will soon be but two nations—the English and the
French. Before many generations have passed
away, they will even stand face to face alone upon
the globe. They must become, not only allies, but
friends. Already you will perceive that their mutual
hatred has become tradition. The wars between
these two great nations have often partaken
of the chivalrous character of the ancient duel, in
which the combat was carried on less from antipathy
or thirst of vengeance, than from a boyish
valour and love of glory. Believe me, where genius
and courage are equal, peace becomes indispensable—two
countries cannot make war upon each other
until both fall dead upon the field of battle; destruction
is not triumph. The good which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
sprung up, even amidst their mutual jealousies,
has been immense; much more has been sown
than has yet been gathered, but the seed which has
thus been buried will bring forth fruit, in its own
good time, to benefit the whole human race.</p>

<p>“You will find, by the study of history, that they
have proceeded in the goodly work together, as
though by a tacit agreement, working with the same
perseverance and the same success, to promote the
progress of reason and the advancement of prosperity
throughout the world. It was at the very
same instant that the cry of horror at the tyranny
and oppression of the people arose from the heart
of each, and hand in hand did their philosophers
and men of genius sound the first alarm at the
encroachments of despotism. They are destined
to regenerate the world.”</p>

<p>I may be forgiven if I listened to this eloquent
and soothing speech as to a hallowed prophecy.
The theme was one upon which I could have loved
to hear him expatiate yet further; but other matters
soon pressed upon his attention, and drove the
subject from his mind. I observed, however, during
my stay at Valençay, that the prince took every
opportunity of exalting and approving England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
and of putting forth his favourite theory of an <em>exclusive</em>
alliance between the French and English.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the toilet was proceeding rapidly under
the skilful hands of the two veteran valets; and
while I was contemplating with infinite satisfaction
a scene to me so novel in its details, the prince,
who was in excellent spirits, kept up with even more
than his wonted share of vivacity the ball of conversation.
Many of the stories which he told that
morning were exceeding curious and worthy of
record. I was much struck with some observations
which he made with regard to the policy and conduct
of Louis the Eighteenth, a sovereign whom he
disliked most particularly. To one who carried
the principle of forgiveness of injuries to the extent
to which the Prince de Talleyrand displayed
throughout his career, the cold, vindictive nature of
Louis must have been singularly obnoxious, while
the sense of obligation must have pressed heavily
enough upon the small soul of the monarch.
Besides which, a rivality of wit had sprung up between
them, which served to increase their mutual
dislike and distrust of each other. Louis Dixhuit
could not bear the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">succès</i> which some of the bon-mots
of the Prince had obtained, and sought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
humiliate and embarrass him by direct attacks, as if
to put to the proof before the courtiers the well-earned
reputation for repartee which the prince had
acquired. But the prince always came out of the
affray with honour, his self-possession giving him
an immense advantage over the irritable temper of
the king.</p>

<p>On the day when Madame de Talleyrand (who
had been sent to England with a pension) re-appeared
in Paris, the king, who seized every opportunity
to annoy M. de Talleyrand before the court,
exclaimed, on perceiving him, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah, monsieur, que
je vous plains!</i> Is it true that Madame is arrived
in France?” “Alas, it is, sire. I also was doomed
to have <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon vingt Mars!</i>” The king did not
reply, but walked before the line of courtiers, biting
his lip, as was his wont when vexed. Presently he
returned, and again stood before the recreant wit,
who alone looked all unmoved and unconscious
amidst the general hilarity.</p>

<p>“Prince de Talleyrand,” said he, in a severe tone,
“is it not time for you to seek the country? Paris
is growing hot. I have been told that the shades
of Valençay are the coolest and most delightful in
all France.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
“Sire, they have lost that reputation since Ferdinand
VII. cut down my lime trees to make bonfires
at the Emperor’s fête!”</p>

<p>Once more was the king reduced to silence, and
this time more effectually, for he did not return
again to the charge; but he said to M. Decazes
that evening, “Talleyrand answers as though he
were <em>afraid</em> of an encounter; in short, he always
seems as if he considered himself attacked.”</p>

<p>I had often felt a desire to know the real opinion
of M. de Talleyrand concerning the character of
Louis Dixhuit, and I considered myself particularly
fortunate that the conversation should have
turned upon the subject. It was evident that he
held in small esteem the principles of the Bourbon,
whose crooked policy and cowardly revenge once
drew from him an approval of the memorable words
of Fox—“Of all revolutions, the worst is a restoration!”
The indignation must have been great
which could have caused this bitter criticism upon
his own work, for he it was who, by the avowal of
the king himself, had planned and executed his
great principle of legitimacy, and restored the
Bourbons to the throne.</p>

<p>“Louis Dixhuit was the veriest liar that ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
trode the earth,” said the prince. “His love of
falsehood was so great, that those admitted to his
intimacy had grown to dread the expression from
his lips of any kindness, feeling sure that disgrace
was nigh. He was the greatest hater I ever met
with; cold and calculating in his vengeance, and
meanly taunting in its gratification. I cannot describe
to you my disappointment when I first beheld
him in 1814, after the events which had
changed him from a miserable exile into the sovereign
of the greatest European country. He received
me in the palace at Compiègne. I could
judge the character of the man by the manner of
his greeting. He was in the great gallery of the
château, surrounded by his friends and many of
the foreign diplomates, who were all eager and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">empressé</i> in their congratulations—all full of hope
and bright anticipations of the future. I may, without
being suspected of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fatuité</i>, declare that a
murmur of welcome ran through the assembly
when my name was announced, and the king advanced
a few steps to meet me with a warm and
friendly welcome. He pressed my hand with great
kindness, and drawing forward a chair which stood
beside him, exclaimed, ‘Prince de Benevent, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
seated—and believe me, I do not forget that had
it not been for your assistance in the late events,
they might have turned in a different chance, and
<em>you</em> might have said to <em>me</em>, “Count de Lille, be
seated.”’</p>

<p>“The phrase appeared to me so artificial, so stiff
and embarrassed, that I involuntarily looked his
majesty full in the face for an explanation. By
that single glance I could tell that I was not destined
to remain a minister of Louis Dixhuit, and
my anticipations proved true, although he knew
well that had it not been for my exertions, he would
not have regained his throne until much later—perhaps,
indeed, never!</p>

<p>“The dinner which succeeded the grand reception
I shall never forget. Everyone had expected
that the conversation would have been most interesting;
that the most important topic of the day
would have been duly discussed and commented
upon. Each guest had come prepared with his
own peculiar suggestion concerning the most effective
entry into Paris. Each one had his bon-mot
for approval, some appropriate phrase to be printed
in the journals. I myself am forced to plead guilty
to the like ambition, and obtained the honour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
preference over many which, in my opinion, were
far better and more piquant than my ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Français de
plus</i>,’ although its subsequent popularity justified
in some measure its adoption. Whatever might
have been our anticipations, it soon became evident
that the monarch had learned one great accomplishment
during his exile, and he ate in silence of
every dish which was presented to him. The
court, principally composed of men who had been
accustomed to the rapid and noisy dinners of the
Emperor, soon began to grow weary of the tedious
deglutition of the king, and became ere long
reduced to be the mere spectators of his enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Not one single word had been spoken during
the whole of the first course. It would be impossible
to describe the extraordinary effect of that
silence, undisturbed save by the timid rattle of the
knives and forks, and the hesitating steps of the
servants. We gazed at each other with embarrassment.
No one dared to speak even to his neighbour
save in a whisper; when, just about the middle
of the second course, an event occurred which
served to arouse us from the stupor into which we
had fallen. The king was about to help himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
from the dish of spinach which had been handed
to him by the servant, when the intention was suddenly
arrested by a loud exclamation from the
Duke de Duras, who, rising from his chair, and
leaning forward with an earnest and stricken look,
exclaimed, ‘For the love of Heaven, your Majesty,
touch not that spinach!’ The king let fall the
spoon which was already half way towards his
plate, and raised his eyes in alarm—he was pale as
death. There were few, indeed, at the table who
did not change countenance at this unexpected
exclamation. Suspicions of foul treason—of premeditated
crime, immediately filled every eye, and
we looked aghast towards the duke for an explanation.
Even I myself, although prepared by experience
for every exaggeration of court flattery, could
not resist the dread of some terrible disclosure.</p>

<p>“‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pourquoi pas?</i>’ faltered out the king, his
nasal twang rendered even more tremulous than
usual by the terror under which he laboured.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, sire, I warn you—be advised by me; eat
not of that spinach—it is drest with most villanous
butter!’</p>

<p>“The etiquette of the royal table, of course, prevented
the explosion of the roar of laughter with
which the speech would have been greeted had it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
not been for the mighty presence; and even as it
was, an irrepressible titter ran round the room. The
king, however, did not laugh; the subject was of
too much importance to be trifled with; he looked
first at the Duc de Duras with an expression of
doubt, then raised the dish to his nose, pushed it
from him with a sigh, and exclaiming, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est pourtant
vrai!</i>’ sank back in his chair to brood upon
his disappointment.</p>

<p>“After this event, the silence certainly continued
still, but not the embarrassment, for, during the rest
of the entertainment, we were all convulsed with suppressed
laughter, and although of course good
breeding and the rules of etiquette prevented its explosion,
the conviction that we mutually understood
the joke made us feel its relish the more keenly.
The dinner concluded while this ludicrous impression
lasted, and we retired to the drawing-room, glad
to be emancipated from the restraint which sitting
thus face to face with royalty always occasions.</p>

<p>“After a moment’s consultation amongst ourselves,
we decided that it would be advisable to
proceed at once to business, as many of us wished
to return to Paris as soon as possible, to forward
the measures concerning the public entrance of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
majesty into the capital. I was spokesman upon the
occasion, and ventured to suggest the propriety of
at once opening the discussion at which we were all
come prepared to be amicable wranglers. To our
great surprise, his only answer was, ‘<em>Let us digest
first</em>; we will speak of business another time.’</p>

<p>“I leave you to imagine the effect produced by
these words. The action which accompanied them
was even more expressive of his earnestness in the
pursuit which he recommended, for he sank calmly
down among the cushions of the sofa, and in another
moment, before our astonishment had subsided,
was lost in the sweetest and most quiet slumber I
ever witnessed. It was a source of the greatest
amusement to us all, as we moved noiselessly about
the room, and spoke to each other by signs or in
low whispers in order to avoid interrupting the important
slumbers of the sovereign, to behold from
the windows of the palace the eager expectation of
the crowd assembled in the court below, whose
anxious countenances, lighted up by the glare of the
illuminations which decorated the frontage of the
building, gave token of the intense interest with
which they were regarding the moving shadows of
those within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
“No doubt they deemed that the proceedings
there taking place were big with the fate of the
empire—the destiny of thousands of their fellow-countrymen.
Each time that any form of more
than ordinary dimensions happened to pass before
the windows, it was immediately taken for that of
the king, and was greeted with loud shouting and
applause, which, however, failed to reach the ear of
him for whom it was intended, and who still slumbered
on, all unconscious either of the disappointment
of those within or the expectation of those
without.</p>

<p>“This apparently insipid and eventless dinner
was to me one of the most extraordinary and interesting
I ever remember, and it has remained a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">souvenir</i>, when others, more remarkable for the wit
and spirit of the guests or the generosity of the entertainer,
have long ago been forgotten. It placed me
at once <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au courant</i> as to the views and habits of
our ‘restored sovereign.’ In no one of the anticipations
formed from this interview was I deceived.
Selfish, insensible, luxurious, ungrateful, did I ever
find him. This dinner at Compiègne was the very
picture of his whole reign, and he fully justified
the words of my honest friend Dunoyer—‘Among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
the millions of human lives confided to his charge,
there is but <em>one</em> of value in his eyes; and that one
the most valueless of all to the whole world
besides.’”</p>

<p>“This repast must have equalled in its interest
the famous dinner of the Consulte, eh? you remember,
prince?” said the Count de Montrond,
who had been listening attentively.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do remember, and more’s the pity,”
returned the prince, with a gentle laugh, “and I
often wish that I could forget the circumstances
attendant on that dinner. People talk of the
<em>sublime</em> and ridiculous; but the <em>horrible</em> and ridiculous
which were mingled in that scene rendered
it altogether one of the most powerful and extraordinary
of any I have ever witnessed, either
mimicked on the stage or played in real life. I
must tell you that I had considered myself extremely
fortunate in my transactions with the representatives
of the different Italian States who had
assembled at Lyons to negotiate for the protection
of their liberties by France. There remained but
one clause of our treaty to be disputed—the most
knotty point of all, and the one which I felt would
exercise my utmost powers of persuasion when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
came to be discussed in council. In order to conciliate
as much as possible the opposing belligerents,
I had been obliged to have recourse to the
bait which seldom fails, if well ordered and well
executed, that of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dîner diplomatique</i>, trusting to
my worthy ally, Carême, who, in cookery, had
talent enough in his own person to finish what our
united talents in diplomacy had so well begun.</p>

<p>“The dinner, then, was decided on; the day had
arrived; and I was alone in my study, composing
myself for the great struggle which was about to
take place, when M. de la Bernardière came hurrying
in, pale and breathless. ‘Well, we have committed
a pretty blunder,’ said he; ‘only see; with
all the “very clever men” by whom we are surrounded,
what great fools we must be.’ He placed
upon my desk an open letter which he had just
received. It was from the secretary of the Archbishop
of M—— to M. de la Bernardière, who
was then supposed to be acting as <em>my</em> secretary.
A letter purporting to be written in the strictest
confidence, from ‘one gentleman to another,’ from
a secretary to a man of honour, holding the same
important office, having the same ministerial
functions to fulfil, &amp;c.; containing a sort of mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
warning; a kind of covert denunciation
against the whole proceedings of the Consulte; a
threat of failure in all our schemes; an assurance
that all the ambitious views of France were perfectly
understood; and the letter concluded by
declaring that they would be unmasked if the Archbishop
of M—— were not invited to the dinner!
I must own that this announcement took us rather
by surprise; we had reckoned upon the Archbishop
of M—— as one of the firmest allies of
France, and it was, indeed, by a most inconceivable
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bévue</i> that he had been left out. It must
have occurred, no doubt, through some awkward
mismanagement on the part of the servants; but,
whatever the cause, and it was then too late to
enter into any examination, it became evident that
the remedy must be applied at once, and that the
company of the archbishop must be secured without
delay.</p>

<p>“It was M. de la Bernardière, then, who was
commissioned to be the bearer of our humble excuses
for the neglect of which the servants had
been guilty, and our humble request that his
Grandeur would overlook the awkwardness of our
domestics, and accord us the advantage of his presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
at the dinner, which certainly would not be
complete without his company. I must confess
that I awaited the return of La Bernardière with
the greatest anxiety, as I was quite as fully aware
of the necessity of securing the good-will of the
Archbishop as the officious secretary himself could
possibly be. La Bernardière, however, returned
triumphant, and the description which he gave us
of his visit added to the amusement caused by our
groundless fears. He had found the archbishop
attired in flowered dressing-robe and broidered
slippers, reclining on an ottoman of curious workmanship,
which had been presented to him on that
very morning by a deputation of the manufacturers
of the good city of Lyons, and the scene altogether
had reminded him of an episode of the middle
ages. His Grandeur the Lord Archbishop was a
singular-looking personage; the melancholy expression
of his countenance contrasting with ludicrous
effect with the fat, rubicund jollity of his form
and features. He was a large, heavy man, with a
look of absolute despair, and perpetual groans
issued from his brawny chest, like the angry bellowings
of Mount Vesuvius. At his feet were seated,
on a low stool, two young boys, who were chanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
from the same book, and whose rare false
notes were now and then punished by a smart kick
behind, from his grandeur’s peaked slipper.</p>

<p>“He sighed sorrowfully when La Bernardière was
announced, and received him with many a lugubrious
lamentation on the miserable weather, which,
by-the-bye, was beautiful; then he groaned deeply
at the badness of the music of the mass at the
cathedral on the day before, which, being of the
very best order, and under the superintendence of
the maëstro di capello of the Emperor of Austria,
had been by every one else considered excellent;
then he moaned at having been induced to leave
his own country to come to such a place as Lyons,
where it was evident his presence was neither
sought nor needed, and finally pronounced a most
bitter archiepiscopal curse upon the miserable fare
of the hotel where he was staying, regretting, with
most sublime energy, that he should ever have
been induced to travel without his own cook, and
vowing before the Virgin that he never would do
the like again.</p>

<p>“This was the opportunity for La Bernardière to
press his suit and to pray forgiveness for neglect,
and to urge his presence at our table with many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
an assurance of the utter discomfiture and despair
which his refusal would occasion. The countenance
of the worthy archbishop lighted up at the
mention of the dinner. He was evidently a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon
vivant</i> of the first class, and it was doubtless to
this quality that he owed both the rotundity of his
person and the mournful discontent under which
he laboured. He apparently deemed, however,
that a little hesitation was necessary to preserve
his dignity in the eyes of La Bernardière, and he
summoned his secretary to learn from him if it
were possible to accept an invitation upon so short
a notice—if there were no other engagement to interfere
with his desire to prove his respect and
consideration for M. de Talleyrand by accepting
both the invitation and the excuses so courteously
conveyed. Of course the secretary was too well
schooled to decide precipitately; he had to consult
his registers, his list of invitations for the week,
&amp;c.; however, La Bernardière soon perceived that
there was little danger of refusal. The prospect of
a real French dinner, Carême and Minguet, was
too much for the philosophy of the archbishop;
and as La Bernardière had anticipated, he ended
by not only accepting the invitation, but almost
excusing himself for having hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
“It was a real satisfaction to learn the acquiescal
of his grandeur, for we had waited in fear and
trembling the return of La Bernardière. It was
immediately resolved among the little knot of gentlemen
gathered in the salon that it would be
necessary to display even more courtesy towards
him at the dinner-table in consequence of this involuntary
neglect; and thus, much to my subsequent
discomfiture, it was agreed that the poor
archbishop was to be placed at my right hand. I
was exceedingly diverted at the extreme self-complacency
with which he received all our demonstrations
of respect, all our contrivances to do him
honour—a mixture of embarrassment and haughtiness
which I have never seen equalled. But at
sight of the dinner all stiffness and formality were
banished. His heavy countenance brightened,
and he exhibited the most lively interest in every
arrangement, tormenting me terribly to know the
name of every dish which was handed to him, then
questioning the servant who presented it upon
the nature of the ingredients employed in its composition,
and finally calling, in a shrill tone, for
‘Nino,’ the short fat man who stood behind his
chair, dressed in a livery which, I believe, is called
heraldic, and which is all striped and cross-barred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
with every colour in the rainbow—red, yellow,
blue, white, as many, in short, as there may be
quarterings in the escutcheon, producing an effect
more resembling that of the pictures on playing
cards than anything else that can be imagined.</p>

<p>“This ‘Nino’ would stoop forward and lean his
chin upon the shoulder of his grandeur, and his
grandeur would point with a fat, white, stumpy
finger to some particular dish upon the table, and
after a few moments whispered conversation between
the pair, Nino would disappear for a short
time, and then return all in a heat and blaze. He
had evidently been despatched to the kitchen for
information respecting the origin and composition
of the approved <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morceau</i>, in order that it might be
reproduced at some future time upon the archiepiscopal
table. His delight at every new discovery
of this nature was perfectly uncontrollable,
and he would chuckle and clap his hands like a
child whenever a fresh dish, wearing a tempting
exterior, was placed before him.</p>

<p>“To me his grandeur was unfolding a new chapter
in the eternal history of human eccentricity,
and I watched every motion with the most intense
interest. Towards the end of the repast, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
ecstasies with which he had greeted the endeavours
of our French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artistes</i>, and, perhaps, also
the enormous efforts which he had used to prove
his admiration of their talents, had produced a
state of excitement which rather began to alarm
me, the more so as even La Bernardière had not
been able to win a moment’s attention, so absorbed
had his grandeur been with the culinary excellence
of our political system. Every dish had been discussed
by the archbishop; neither <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entremets</i> nor
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors d’œuvre</i>, however insignificant, had escaped
investigation, until, at last, I grew perfectly amazed
at the quantity which had been absorbed, and perceived,
with an indescribable feeling of terror and
dismay, the hue of dark purple, which, beginning
with his ears, had gradually overspread his whole
physiognomy, and more particularly the look of
stolid dulness with which he now eyed the table.</p>

<p>“‘Your grandeur is ill,’ said I, in a whisper;
‘allow me to order yon window to be opened
above your head, or would you prefer to retire
for a moment to breathe the air upon the staircase?’</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ returned the archbishop, ‘I have not
finished dinner yet,’ and immediately helped himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
most copiously from a dish of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artichauts à la
Barigoul</i>, (a dish for which, by-the-bye, my cook
was famous,) and fell to eating once again, as if
refreshed by the pause he had been compelled to
make. I was verily astounded! His grandeur
seemed to have reserved all his energies for the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artichauts à la Barigoul</i>, and devoured them with
as much gusto as though he had eaten nothing
since morning.</p>

<p>“It was during the mastication of this most approved
morsel that La Bernardière at last succeeded
in making the little request in favour of our
country which had been hovering on his tongue
during the whole of dinner. His grandeur hesitated
not; he was ready to grant everything; he
could refuse nothing to any one in this hour of
plenitude and satisfaction, and I, in my turn, plied
him with propositions and demonstrations, to all
of which he assented by a dignified inclination of
the head. Emboldened by the view of my unexpected
success, La Bernardière took up the burden
of my discourse, with an increase of vigour and an
increase of presumption, as is invariably the case
with solicitors when undisturbed by opposition.
Question after question was proposed to the archbishop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
who assented to all our demands in the
same quiet manner, until I advanced <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le point culminant</i>
of our requests, which really did seem to
stagger him, for he raised his head suddenly, and
remained an instant gazing on me with a vacant
stare, then bent forward, as I thought, to whisper
his objections more closely into my ear, and to my
terror, as I looked up to listen for his answer, fell
forward with his face upon my bosom, without
sense and without motion, the dull, gurgling sound
in his throat alone giving assurance that life still
remained!</p>

<p>“I cannot describe to you the alarm and horror
of that moment. I could not shake him off. I
had not strength to move the weighty mass. I
dreaded, of all things, making a scene and disturbing
the whole company, and called as loudly as
the immense weight pressing upon my throat and
bosom would allow me to do, for ‘Nino!’ But,
alas! Nino had been deputed to the kitchen a few
minutes before in search of the receipt for the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artichauts à la Barigoul</i>, and I was, therefore,
compelled to support this ponderous mass unheeded,
unobserved. In spite of the alarm and
the personal inconvenience which I felt, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
big drops of perspiration were rolling down my
face, and every muscle was strained to the utmost,
yet was there something so ridiculous in the whole
scene, that had it not been for that livid countenance
so close to my own, those goggling, protruding
eyeballs so close to mine, it would almost
have created laughter; but it was too horrible!
I shall never forget the expression of that face; it
will haunt me to my dying day.</p>

<p>“How long I might have remained in this ludicrous
position I know not, for every one was busy
and boisterous, chatting and laughing with his
neighbour; even the traitor La Bernardière had
turned away and was now in full heat of a good
story, which he was recounting to his companion
on the other side, leaving me, as he imagined, fully
occupied with the seduction of the archbishop.
At length my deliverance was accomplished, the
ever-watchful Nino, all breathless and panting hot
from the kitchen, perceived my danger even from
the door of the banqueting-hall, and, bounding
across the floor, seized his master by the collar and
pulled him backwards with violence into his chair,
where he lay, motionless. By a simultaneous movement,
as if attracted by some magic spell, the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
company turned at once towards us;—a cry of horror
burst from the guests at the contemplation of that
ghastly countenance. The confusion, of course,
became general, every seat was abandoned, and
the guests crowded round us with recommendations
and offers of assistance; but the screaming
voice of the piebald ‘Nino’ was heard loud above
the hubbub and confusion. ‘Leave him to me; I
know him of old. Stand back. Lord, as if this
were the first time! You see he only wants to
breathe, and he can’t, because his teeth are
closed.’ With these words he seized upon the
poor archbishop, and after looking round the table
in vain for an instrument, he drew from his pocket
a huge iron door-key, and attempted, with the effort
of a Hercules, to force it between the set, clenched
jaws of the archbishop. But alas! they were already
set and clenched in death, and no human power
could now avail.</p>

<p>“His grandeur was dead; the melancholy fact
was too visible to all present, excepting, indeed,
to the obtuse perceptions of ‘Nino,’ who, in spite
of remonstrance and opposition, would insist on
repeating his experiment, until at last, with a
horrible crash, the strong front teeth of the archbishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
gave way; and roused by the certitude
of his misfortune, the unhappy Nino burst into
a yell of despair which echoed to the very roof
of the apartment. I leave you to judge of the
effect of the whole scene, and of the extent of
the appetite with which we returned to the table
when the ugly sight was removed; and yet, no
sooner had the ghastly corpse, borne upon men’s
shoulders, and followed by the howling Nino,
passed through the yawning door, than the conversation
was resumed, perhaps even with more
energy than before: the jingling of glasses, the
clatter of knives were renewed with even more
noisy glee, and soon, to all appearance, the very
memory of the awful circumstance to which we
had all borne witness seemed to have been forgotten,
for the laughter and the shouting, the eager
gesture and the noisy discussion were resumed, as
if nought had happened to disturb the harmony of
the meeting.</p>

<p>“The due meed of lying toasts were likewise
bawled forth; vows for the ‘<em>Fraternity of Europe</em>,’
and ‘<em>Universal Union</em>,’ &amp;c., with some few favourite
names, were also shouted with much riot and applause.
Disputes of the most animated kind, concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the rival merits of divers of our public
men, were also started and quelled, but never
once was the subject with which every heart must
have needs been full made the topic of a single
observation. I observed that many, while loudest
and most clamorous in their discourse, would cast
a shuddering glance towards the chair which had
so lately been filled with the violet robes and
portly dignity of the Lord Archbishop, and which
stood now empty and reproachful by my side;
then, by a sudden effort turn away and grow more
clamorous and noisy than before; but, as I have
already said, not once was the subject of his
miserable death alluded to in any one of the numberless
speeches which were subsequently uttered.
One would have thought that he had been forgotten
on the instant, although his cover still
remained upon the board, and his jewelled snuff-box
still sparkled beside it. While yet the very
presence of the man hovered round us, he was, to
outward seeming, as much unthought of as though
he had never been.”</p>

<p>This story gave rise to others of the same
nature, and many were the anecdotes related of
sudden death, the summons which startles men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
in the midst of revelry and festival, at council-board
or in the judgment-seat. Some of these
are well known, others would have but small interest
for the general reader, but one of the most
curious was told by the prince himself with the
piquant raciness in which he so much excelled,
and which has graven the history in my memory.
It happened during a time, too, which possessed
a peculiar interest to me—a time which, in spite of
its importance, has found but few chroniclers—the
period of the occupation of Paris by the allied
armies, and the visit of the sovereigns of Europe,
in 1815. Men’s minds were so agitated by the
crowding of events the one upon the other, by
dread anticipations of what would come next, that
public feeling was taken by surprise, and scarcely
had time to set up its own standard, or leisure to
record its own impressions; this I take to be the
reason why so few of the memoirs of our day contain
any special description of the state of society
at that time.</p>

<p>“I had been dining with a circle of wary, ever-watchful
diplomates of the lesser kind, Russians,
Austrians, and Prussians,” began the prince;
“every word had been weighed in the balance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
prudence and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">prévoyance</i> before I had ventured to
give it utterance. Not a syllable of the conversation
of others had been permitted to fall unheeded
on my ear, and the extreme tension of intellect
which it had required, both in weighing my own
words and in watching those of others, had,
at last, so wearied my mind, that I experienced a
feeling of vacancy, an exhaustion of moral power,
which might be compared to nothing but inebriation.
When the repast was over, I strolled forth
on foot to seek my old friend and comforter, Bergasse.
I knew by experience that an hour spent
with him would restore my spirit to its equilibrium,
and soothe, by the counter-irritation of his fund of
whimsical argument, the agitation of my nervous
system. He was not at home, however, and I was
turning away, disappointed, from his lodgings, when
his valet, an old confidential servant, followed me
with the information, that, if I needed Monsieur
very much, he had left word where he was to be
found; he had gone to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soirée</i> at Madame de
Krudener’s; it was to be a grand gala night at
her house, and the Emperor Alexander was to be
among the guests!</p>

<p>“This information of course roused me at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
from the fatigue and lethargy of my diplomatic
dinner, and I determined to do that night what I
had never done before, in spite of the frequent
solicitations of the fair <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">philosophe</i> herself, go to
‘the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soirée</i> at Madame de Krudener’s;’ nay, there
was something in the very project which seemed
to revive my flagging spirits, and I set forth on my
expedition, determined to be amused; this object
being already more than half attained by the very
determination alone.</p>

<p>“When I arrived in the Rue de Cléry, where
Madame de Krudener then resided, I found the
street impassable—a crowd of carriages of every
description filling it from one end to the other. I
immediately perceived among the number admitted
into the courtyard the plain green carriage and unpretending
liveries of the Emperor Alexander. It
is an extraordinary thing how time and place will
suddenly tend to the development of certain sentiments,
which, even if they have existed before, have,
perhaps, been rather repulsed than encouraged.
Thus it was with me on the night in question.
No sooner had I beheld the pressure of the crowd,
the difficulty of obtaining admittance into the
sanctum of Madame de Krudener, than I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
seized with an indescribable longing to press forward,
and a regret that I had never been to her receptions
before. It was some time before I could
force my way through the dense mass of visitors
which obstructed the staircase. However, in all
matters, great or small, everything happens, to those
who know how to wait with patience, and my turn
did come in due course, and I also found myself
ushered into the mighty presence. How different
did I find this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">huitaine</i> from those I had witnessed
at her former residence!</p>

<p>“The whole scene of former days flashed upon
me, as I made my way through the rooms towards
the sanctorum wherein the divinity of the place sat
enshrined in mysterious and hallowed seclusion.
When I had last beheld her, before her departure
for Riga, she was in the bloom of youth and beauty;
her complexion, of exquisite fairness, bespoke her
northern origin, while the delicate and graceful form
bore all the softness of the south. The long
ringlets of golden hair which shaded her face in
such rich luxuriance had been the theme of many
an ode and sonnet, while her grace in the dance
had made many an unhappy ‘Gustave’ among the
sad <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">incroyables</i> of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
“I now found her, after a lapse of years, the
same in all things, and yet, how strangely altered!
Her youth was gone; and her beauty, of which she
still possessed some little share, no longer satisfied
that ardent thirst of admiration, that morbid, eager
craving for popularity, which had possessed her soul
from her childhood upwards. She had been greeted
with divine honours, and divinity she would insist
upon remaining, in spite of the change which had
taken place both in herself and in her worshippers.
She had exchanged her pedestal of alabaster,
wreathed with roses, for one of mere painted paste-board,
and only maintained her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">àplomb</i> upon its
narrow surface by the strangest efforts and contortions.
It was a curious scene; such a one as
I should have thought it impossible to see enacted
in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>“The rooms were crowded; and, with an admirable
comprehension of theatrical display, the fair
hostess remained in the furthermost of all from the
entrance. A space of the width of the doorways
through which you had to pass was kept vacant for
the approach of strangers. It was thus that, through
a long lane of curious gazers, I was e’en forced to
wend my way towards the place where Madame de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Krudener sat, in her hallowed and almost solitary
glory. In the midst of all that was singular in this
extraordinary reception, what struck me most was
the unearthly silence which reigned in the assembly.
Not a word was uttered above a whisper, and the
few greetings of friendly recognition with which I
was hailed as I passed through the <em>seven</em> chambers,
all crowded to excess, were scarcely audible from
the low tone in which they were uttered. The
room which Madame had honoured with her preference
was a very small boudoir at the extreme
end of the apartment. I observed in a moment
that those which I had traversed were dimly and
poorly lighted, although there was animation enough
imparted to the assembly by the gay <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parure</i> of the
ladies, and the glittering uniforms of all nations,
which were gathered there; but the effect was so
artistically managed, that, as you looked forward
down a narrow, shaded vista, the single point brilliantly
lighted—the white dress of the lady became
the immediate centre of attraction.</p>

<p>“Madame received me most graciously, and I
will confess that it was not without some emotion
that I bent low to kiss her hand. She courteously
reminded me of former times, and, in the sweetest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
tones which ever fell upon the human ear, reproached
me gently for my tardy compliance with
her oft-repeated invitation. There certainly was
something irresistible in her voice and manner; for
I, who had come prepared to resist, yielded to the
charm without a struggle, and gazed at her with an
interest which I had little expected to feel. She
was at that time fast verging towards the dreaded
forty, and it was even said that it was merely owing
to the disagreement in the two calendars that she
had not already passed that fatal boundary, and
she defended herself, with most amusing earnestness,
against the charge brought forward by the evil-disposed
persons who accused her of being both
‘visionary and quadragenary.’ However, time
had dealt kindly with her, having left traces of his
passage more upon her figure than her face. Both
had increased and spread; the bloom and freshness
had departed, but wrinkles and suffusion had
not yet arrived.</p>

<p>“She was attired in a robe of her own invention,
made of some kind of woollen stuff of the
purest white, long, full, and flowing, with sleeves
which reached to the very ground; the whole was
edged with silver, and the robe was confined at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
waist by a silver girdle. Her hair, which was still
beautiful as ever, although not quite of so bright a
golden hue as I remembered it, hung loose down
her back and over her bosom, reaching to the waist
in the most beautiful ringlets, which, whether the
effect of nature or of art, were well calculated to enhance
the expression of her inspired attitudes.
There was exquisite coquetry in the manner in
which, by a gentle movement, she shook the ringlets
from her brow, in order to clear her vision,
when any new visitor drew near, and in the peculiarly
graceful motion with which she would draw
her hand now and then across her eyes, as if to
shade the light for an instant, during which the
snowy fingers, laden with gems, glistened through the
drooping curls with an effect perfectly bewildering.</p>

<p>“She was reclining upon a low divan which ran
along the wall, supported by cushions of crimson
velvet, which set off her fair complexion and the
dazzling whiteness of her dress to the greatest
advantage. On one side stood the Emperor Alexander,
attired in a suit of black, with no mark of
his high rank save the glittering star of brilliants
on his bosom. If he had come prepared to
heighten the effect of Madame de Krudener’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tableau</i>, he could not have adopted a costume and
bearing more in harmony with her intentions. On
the other side, leaning backward in his chair, with
the most perfect nonchalance imaginable, sat the
King of Prussia <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en personne</i>. Before I had recovered
from the surprise which the latter discovery
had occasioned, my hand was seized in a friendly
grasp by my old friend and ally, Bergasse, who,
together with a sombre, wild-looking individual,
was seated on a low stool at the feet of the prophetess,
both having, apparently, been occupied in
transcribing the words which fell from her lips, for
each was armed with a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">calpin</i> and pencil-case.</p>

<p>“When I had paid my respects to the lady, I
was about to retire, as I supposed was the etiquette
for casual visitors, but I was destined to feel the
advantage of possessing a ‘friend at court,’ for
Bergasse drew me gently back, and led me to a
seat in the corner of the room, where I remained
an observer, unobserved, of all that was going on
around me. Bergasse endeavoured for a moment
to satisfy my curiosity by a few brief answers to
my whispered questions, but he had no time to
waste upon a poor, uninitiated novice like myself,
and he soon left me, and resumed his seat by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
side of his necromantic-looking companion. However,
from the few short words he had found time
to utter, he informed me that I was in great good
luck that evening, for Madame de Krudener was
in one of her most ecstatic moods, and had already
three times experienced the state of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">extase</i>, and,
while under this influence, had given utterance to
some of the most powerful and most beautiful prophecies
and denunciations, which himself and his
friend had most righteously transcribed, word for
word, and in the order of their utterance.</p>

<p>“‘Who is your companion?’ said I, pointing to
the long, thin figure in black which remained gathered
up at the feet of the lady.</p>

<p>“‘That is our new <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">illuminé</i>,’ returned Bergasse,
triumphantly. ‘It is Jüng Stilling, who has left
home, family, and friends, to follow our inspired
mistress. I have attached myself to Madame de
Krudener from admiration and conviction; he has
done so from the sympathy of mystic science, the
strongest of all ties. How I regret, my friend, that
I began not life as I now am ending it, in communion
with the lofty-minded, the inspired. How
I grieve now over the time lost, the unambitious
aims of my youth! Why come you not with us?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
In our existence is true happiness only to be
found.’</p>

<p>“‘What further he would have added I know not,
for, just then, the dull, sepulchral voice of Jüng
Stilling called him by his name, and he slunk back
to his side, leaving me to contemplate the scene
before me.</p>

<p>“There was a moment of deadly silence after
Bergasse had regained his seat. Madame de Krudener
sat motionless, staring with fixed, unmeaning
gaze upon the vacant space before her. The
Emperor Alexander stood in passive expectation,
not a muscle of his features disturbed, while the
King of Prussia, who at that time never left his
side and never turned his gaze from the autocratical
countenance, looked at it now with more
intent and searching earnestness. Presently the
seeress started from her dream, and slowly arose
from the divan where she had been reclining. She
waved her arm aloft, while yet her fixed gaze
wavered not, and moved a step or two forward.
Nothing could exceed the grandeur of her appearance
at that moment. The long robe in which she
was enveloped, drooped in graceful folds about her
person, and the loose sleeve fell back from the extended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
arm, and displayed its rounded form and
snowy whiteness with most bewitching effect. She
spoke—her voice was deep and solemn, and its
accents fell with slow and measured cadence on
the ear.</p>

<p>“‘Let us pray,’ said she; then paused; while I
could hear from the rooms beyond, and which I
had traversed on my entrance, that peculiar agitation
and bustle which precedes the change of position
in churches. ‘Let us pray; all sinners that
ye are, sink upon your knees, and beg forgiveness
from the God of heaven!’ exclaimed she, in a
louder tone; and in a moment, while yet she stood
with arms uplifted, and with her head thrown back,
every person present, from Alexander, the autocrat
of all the Russias, to the very waiters who had
been handing the refreshments to the company,
sank down upon their knees, and bowed their foreheads
to the very ground! She herself knelt not,
but remained standing, while she poured forth a
prayer, spoken in earnest and burning language;
words of which I have not been able to recall a
syllable to memory, so absorbed was I in contemplation
of all that was passing. I verily believe
that of all that multitude—for I think there must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
have been at least five hundred persons present—there
was not a soul save myself who had dared
to remain seated; and with me it was neither
mockery nor bravado which had caused me to disobey
the injunction, but at the moment I was so
taken by surprise, so absorbed with the novelty of
the scene, that I was scarcely conscious of the impropriety
of which I was guilty. To speak truth, I
was busy comparing the circumstances now passing
before me, with those under which I had last
beheld Madame de Krudener; Garat, the opera
singer, and Bernardin de St. Pierre were then her
supporters. Sounds of mirth and festivity, the
light <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fiorituri</i> of Garat, the mildly-caustic declamation
of Bernardin, had given place to the solemn
tones of the prophetess, the language of love and
gallantry to the language of prayer.</p>

<p>“She continued, for the space of at least an
hour, in a state of inspiration, never ceasing,
during all that time, to hold on her discourse with
the same unhesitating eloquence. She spoke of
Alexander, ‘the white angel of the north,’ predicting
for him and his descendants, glory, happiness,
and honour, unlimited sway from the rising
of the sun to the setting of the same. Then did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
she revert to the black angel of the south, foretelling
that he ‘would escape from his second cage
like a chained lion.’</p>

<p>“The prophecies were uttered with a self-confidence,
an implicit belief, which I could not
but admire; it was so well calculated to inspire
the same feeling in others. The only drawback
was the reflection that none of them had as yet
come true.</p>

<p>“This state of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">extase</i> lasted for some time after
the prayer was ended, during which the whole
assembly remained kneeling. I bent forward and
looked through the open door; not a single gesture
of impatience, not a single wandering glance could
I detect among the crowd. Every head was bent low.
Some even kissed the very floor; and it really was
a curious sight to behold those dainty ladies, those
gaily-dressed courtiers, whose costume of white
kerseymere knee-breeches and silk stockings was
anything but favourable to the kneeling posture,
remain thus without a murmur, so long as it
pleased the fair preacher to hold them in expectation
that she would resume her discourse.</p>

<p>“The prayer was ended at length, and every
one arose, gently, without confusion and without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
noise, and sank again into their seats in silent
meditation, which continued undisturbed by a
single sound for several minutes. The prophetess
had fallen back upon her ottoman, and her golden
locks completely buried her face beneath their
shadow. I would have given much to have been
sure of the expression of her countenance, for once
I became aware that her eye sought mine, and
then I observed that she turned aside to avoid my
scrutiny. Bergasse sprang to my side in delight
and triumph. ‘Is she not splendid?’ inquired he,
with a naïveté of tone and manner at which I was
highly amused. ‘You have heard her in her
glory to-night,’ he whispered in my ear, with an
air of the greatest mystery, while his countenance
changed from the expression of childish admiration,
which it had worn when he had addressed me,
to that of awe and wonder—‘She has had a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pressentiment</i>,
and is under its influence still.’ He
took my arm, and walked with me through the
crowd into the adjoining room.</p>

<p>“As I left the sacred boudoir, I beheld the
‘white angel of the north’ in busy conversation
with the prophetess, and the unhappy King of
Prussia bending forward, eager to catch the slightest
syllable which fell from the lips of the speakers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
but the effort was vain; his neck was too short,
and his eye wandered from the one to the other
with the restless, unquiet look of a person afflicted
with deafness.</p>

<p>“Bergasse turned to me as soon as we were
alone. ‘There is something dreadful about to
happen,’ said he, in a solemn whisper. ‘She has
had her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pressentiment</i> to-night, and she has never
deceived us yet. Something awful is about to
occur here; in this very apartment, perhaps—in
this very room, upon the very spot where we now
are standing!’ He seized my arm and drew me
nearer to his side, then added—‘My dearest friend,
some one is about to <span class="smcap smaller">DIE</span> beneath this very roof!’
I drew back aghast; but Bergasse seemed too much
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">exalté</i> by his subject to care if even he himself
were the victim, provided the prophecy of his
divinity came true. ‘Yes,’ added he, with a grim
smile, ‘<em>she</em> has felt that death is walking amongst
us; he is now, at this moment, choosing his victim.
She has insisted on my sending home my nephew.
She wished me to depart also, but I must not leave
her. Even while I am dallying with you, I am
losing the precious words which fall with such
sweet unction from her tongue.’</p>

<p>“He left me abruptly, and hurried back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
boudoir of Madame de Krudener, while I remained
lost in astonishment, to think that the man, who
had once dealt terror into the heart of the boldest
satirist that ever existed—he who had for awhile,
by his energy and sarcastic bitterness alone, arrested
the headlong progress of Beaumarchais, and
turned the popular tide of ridicule against him who
had so long ridiculed all things with impunity,
should have thus become, in his old age, the puling
slave of a self-deluded impostor, who was prompted
in the comedy she was playing by the wild vagaries
of the ex-tailor, Jüng Stilling. I left the soirée
with feelings of mingled pity and disgust, to which
was added, a strange suspicion concerning the
motive which actuated the ‘white angel of the
north’ in thus making this public display of his
admiration of the prophetess, and consenting to be
made one of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coryphées</i> in the theatrical representations
she was thus in the habit of giving.</p>

<p>“I was scarcely awake the next morning, when
Bergasse rushed into my room, exclaiming, in a
tone of triumph, ‘She did not deceive—it was true—the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pressentiment</i> was justified! Why did you
not stay till later?—you would have <em>seen</em> the truth
with your own eyes, and have been an unbeliever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
no longer.’ With the artful tact of a professed
marvel-monger, he allowed me time for reflection
after he had pronounced these words, and then
resumed, as soon as he perceived that I had collected
my wandering senses.</p>

<p>“‘You were no sooner gone, my friend, than her
inspired prophecy of last evening was fulfilled. I
was seated where you had left me, at her feet, when
a young man of the Neapolitan embassy, who had
been hovering around the door, gathered sufficient
courage to enter the boudoir and make his bow to
Madame de Krudener. His name was Carascola;
he had arrived but a few days since from Naples.
Madame de Krudener had known his mother, and
in courtesy and kindness felt in duty bound to
ask him some few questions concerning the prospects
and intentions which had led him to Paris.
He had answered her questions with that embarrassed
timidity with which young men are used
to reply to their superiors, and Madame de Krudener
had already dismissed him, and turned
again to the “white angel of the north,” whose conversation
had been interrupted by the young man’s
entrance, when suddenly she started from the sofa
as though a pistol-shot had been fired through her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
brain, and darting on me a look of terror, she
exclaimed, faintly, “Bergasse, the hour is come—nought
can save us from the approach of our
Sovereign Lord and Master. He is here—his choice
is made.” At that very instant, I give you my
honour as a gentleman, I beheld Carascola, who
was leaving us, full of youthful spirit, to gain the
outer room, fall forward upon the floor, without
stumbling, without resistance, without convulsion,
but rather as it were sink down softly as though
seeking repose, and there lie stretched his full
length, without sense and without motion. A
crowd soon gathered round him, and they raised
him up; his countenance was pale and his features
frightfully swollen, even in that minute; a doctor
who was present opened a vein upon the forehead,
but it was all of no avail. She had spoken truth.
Death had chosen his victim, and that victim was
Carascola.’</p>

<p>“Such was the tale which Bergasse had come
so early to my bedside to tell me. I ascertained,
that very day, that it was true in every particular,
and was certainly an extraordinary proof of the
possibility of an almost supernatural coincidence.
I doubt not that Madame de Krudener had often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
experienced these <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pressentiments</i> before, but I
much doubt whether any one of them ever came
true so rapidly, so <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">àpropos,</i> as in this case. The
young man had evidently been in a bad state of
health, perhaps subject to fits, from his childhood,
and on this occasion the excitement of meeting
with the august personage he had come to visit,
the heat of the room, the emotion of the prayer
and prophecies, must have caused a congestion of
the brain. I can, however, vouch for the entire
truth of the fact I have related; you must yourselves
arrange the causes, according to your own
scepticism or powers of belief.”</p>

<p>The prince arose as he concluded his story;
his toilet was completed, and he was released from
his tormentors. I was sorry to behold the morning
conference thus breaking up, for I could have
listened on until sunset. I dared, however, to
hazard one single question. “Did you ever see
Madame de Krudener after this?”</p>

<p>The prince bit his lip slily. “Never so close
as on that night,” returned he; “but from a distance,
as such great luminaries should only be gazed at
by vulgar mortals like ourselves. It was at the
review of Alexander’s troops in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaine des Vertus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
a ceremony of which she has left us such
a flaming description. But alas! already was she
no longer the object of exclusive adoration to the
‘white angel of the north,’ for I observed that his
head was often close under the pink bonnet of
Madame du C——, while the yellow ringlets and
broad straw hat of Madame de Krudener were
left to float unheeded in the wind. The purpose
for which he had been playing the comedy of such
assiduous attendance at her prayer-meetings was
evidently answered, and he cared no longer to
expose himself to ridicule for her sake. Soon
after this, she left Paris for ever, and I beheld her
no more. But my niece, who, like many of her
sex, was infatuated with the eloquence and talents
of Madame de Krudener, followed her to the
Greuzacher Horn, whither she had retired. Here
she sank lower in the scale, and no longer preached
to kings and emperors, but to an immense army of
ragged proselytes, whom her generosity in alms-giving,
more than her pious exhortations, had
drawn around her. This same army followed her,
I believe, in all her wanderings, and I am told
that at her death the little colony established itself
at Karasoubazar, where it is flourishing still, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
where almost divine honours are paid to her remains;
pilgrimages are performed to her tomb to
this very day, and miracles are wrought as freely
as at many other shrines.</p>

<p>“It is certain that the game which Alexander
deemed it worth his while to play was a deep one,
for its object has not been discovered to this very
day. I know, from the best authority, that for a
long time he counterfeited entire obedience to her
commands, fasted, prayed, and wept, beat his
bosom and tore his hair when she so ordered it—took
the whole responsibility of the absurd and
childish project of the Holy Alliance upon his
own shoulders—and, in short, gave himself up to
the guidance of one whom he feigned to consider
as Heaven-inspired. And when the allied sovereigns—who
had all, at first, been blinded by the
tinsel of the framework of that famous treaty—turned
round and laughed it to scorn, shamed by the
blunt good sense of England, who had pronounced
the document <em>unintelligible</em> and refused to sign,
Alexander—whether from misplaced <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>,
or from real conviction, still remains a mystery—would
never consent to withdraw his signature.
Whatever may be the merits of the conception of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
that mighty work, it certainly sprang from the
brain of Madame de Krudener alone; but when
complimented upon the stupendous, though ‘unintelligible,’
design, it was her wont to reply with
great modesty, while she flung back her ringlets
and looked towards Heaven, ‘The Holy Alliance is
the immediate work of God. It is He who has
chosen me for his weak, uncertain instrument, and
it is He who has inspired me with the idea of
uniting the sovereigns of Europe in the holy bonds
of brotherly love, for the good of the great human
family under their charge.’”</p>

<p>The prince had moved towards the door even
before his words were quite concluded, and, to my
regret, he turned and bowed to us on the threshold,
and then passed out. It was the hour for business,
and he retired to his own study until the carriage
was announced for his morning drive.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That very evening, the courier from Paris brought
me the summons to repair to my station, which I
dared not disobey; that official summons, sealed
with the official seal, and stamped with the official
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">griffe</i>, which strikes such terror into the hearts of
youthful aspirants to diplomatic fame. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
grown older and wiser since that time, and have
in my turn despatched many an official summons
to strike terror into the heart of some diplomatic
tyro. I have lived to satisfy even my mother’s
ambitious hopes, and have had my full share both
of diplomatic toils and their glittering reward;
but I can never look back without an overwhelming
gratitude and regret towards the time when,
unknown and obscure, I passed those pleasant
hours in the society of the great and illustrious
Prince de Talleyrand, during that short vacation
at Valençay.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<span class="subhead">THE LAST MOMENTS OF PRINCE TALLEYRAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was scarcely six o’clock, on the morning of
the 17th of May (1838), when I bent my steps
towards the old hotel in the Rue St. Florentin,
with a mind full of sad misgivings; for when, at a
late hour on the evening previous, I had quitted it,
I had been but slightly encouraged to hope that
another day could possibly be granted to its proud
and gifted owner. The dull grey dawn was just
struggling to rise above the tall chestnuts of the
Tuileries. All was still silent, and as I pulled the
heavy bell, its echo reverberated through the vast
court-yard with a sound almost unearthly. I did
not pause at the porter’s lodge to inquire news of
the night, for the first object which met my eye was
the physician’s carriage, and I rushed at once to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the foot of the grand staircase, which I had so
often ascended with feelings so far different from
those I now experienced. The two stone figures
of Silence, which stood on each side of the gigantic
portal, humid and dripping with the morning fog,
struck a chill to my very soul. Those huge lions,
which had so often been compared to the insatiate
lions of Venice, now reminded me of those mute
and motionless watchers carved by the marble
gates of an ancient sepulchre. It seemed as if
every object were already enveloped in that atmosphere
of death, and that the old mansion, at all
times sad and dreary, was already pervaded with
the odour of the tomb.</p>

<p>What gave a colouring to this idea was the total
silence which reigned around, where in general,
even at this early hour, all was hurry and business.
The antechamber was deserted, for the anxious
domestics had crowded one and all to the apartment
nearest to that occupied by their beloved
master, in order to obtain the earliest information
respecting the progress of his malady. There
perhaps never existed a person who, with so little
apparent effort, possessed in so great a degree the
power of conciliating the affections of his dependents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
as the Prince de Talleyrand. Of those who
were with him at that moment, all had, with few
exceptions, grown grey in his service; while of
those who had started in their career with him in
his youth, none remained: he had lived to see them
all go down before him into the grave. The prince
had always been accustomed to treat his chief
domestics as persons worthy of confidence, and
many a subject of the highest importance, which
had been nursed with the greatest secrecy through
the bureaux of the Foreign-office, has been discussed
at full length, and with all liberty of speech,
before his valet-de-chambre. It was, indeed, his
custom for many years before his death to select
the hour allotted to his toilet for the transaction of
the most important affairs, and the discussion of
the most weighty politics, and never, upon any
occasion, was he known to dismiss his valet from
the chamber. Perhaps some apology may be
found for this apparent carelessness in the fact of
his trust having never been betrayed.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of the whole tribe was
decidedly the venerable Courtiade, one to whom,
by reason of his long services and devoted attachment,
the prince allowed a greater latitude than to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
any other, and whose homely remarks and shrewd
observations upon passing events, afforded him
the greatest amusement. This man had entered
the prince’s service long before the breaking out
of the first revolution, and died “still in those
voluntary bonds,” during the embassy to London.
It was said that the grief which he experienced in
consequence of being left in Paris, owing to his
advanced age and growing infirmities, contributed,
in a great measure, to hasten his death.</p>

<p>His attachment was rather that of a member of
the canine species than of a human being. During
the early years of his service he had partaken of
all the vicissitudes of the ever-changing fortunes of
his master. The prince would take a peculiar
delight in recounting to strangers the story of his
flight to America, when, in obedience to a secret
friendly warning, he resolved to take his immediate
departure. Courtiade was with him at the moment
that he received the letter which was the cause of
this decision, and the prince immediately confided
to him the step he was about to take, at the same
time advising him, as he had a wife and family to
whom he would doubtless wish to bid adieu before
venturing on so long and perilous a journey, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
especially since the period of his return must be
distant and uncertain, that he should let him depart
at once, and follow in the next packet which
should sail. “Non, non,” replied Courtiade, in
the greatest agitation; “you shall not leave the
country alone and unattended—I will go with you;
but only leave me till to-morrow night!” “That
cannot be, Courtiade,” returned the prince; “the
delay will endanger our position, without being
sufficiently long to be of service to yourself and
your wife.” “Bah! c’est bien de ma femme dont
il s’agit!” exclaimed the valet, with the tears rushing
to his eyes; “it is that accursed washerwoman,
who has got all your fine shirts and your muslin
cravats, and how, in heaven’s name, will you be able
to make an appearance, and in a foreign country
too, without them?”</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first interview with the
prince, nor the singular impression which this
very Courtiade then produced upon me. I was
admitted, as was usual with all persons who came
upon affairs demanding attention and privacy, at
the hour of the prince’s toilet. It was a little while
after the revolution of July, and just before his
embassy to London. I found the renowned diplomatist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
seated tranquilly at his bureau, which mostly
served him both for writing and dressing table. It
was, I believe, upon the very day that the prince
was to take his farewell audience of Louis Philippe,
ere he set out for England, and he was to appear
upon this occasion in the usual court costume.
One valet was busily occupied, with a most serious
countenance, in powdering, with might and main,
the thick masses of his long grey hair. Another
was kneeling low at his feet, endeavouring, although
with difficulty, from his constrained position beneath
the table, to buckle the latchets of his shoes.
His secretary was seated at the bureau beside him,
occupied in opening, one after the other, a huge
collection of letters with astonishing rapidity, scanning
the contents of each, quietly throwing some
into the waste-paper basket, and placing the rest in
a pile beneath for the inspection of the prince. I
could not but admire the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang froid</i> with which,
while listening to my errand, to him personally of
the highest importance, he suffered himself to be
invested with the embroidered paraphernalia of his
official uniform. When the attire was completed,
the door of the chamber opened, and in stalked,
with tottering steps, the aged, weather-beaten Courtiade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
laden with divers small boxes, of various
forms and sizes. These were filled with the
ribands and insignia of the multifarious orders with
which the prince was decorated. It was curious
to witness the total indifference with which he
suffered himself to be ornamented, as contrasted
with the eager solemnity of Courtiade, to whom the
desire to fill this office with becoming dignity (for
it was the only duty which in his latest years devolved
upon him) had become the chief aim and
object of existence.</p>

<p>I have been led into this involuntary digression
by the remembrance of my own sensations as I
traversed the now silent and deserted apartment,
and was carried back in memory to that first interview,
inwardly comparing the anticipations of that
moment with those by which my soul was on this
occasion so depressed and saddened.</p>

<p>When I entered the chamber where reposed the
veteran statesman, he had fallen into a profound
slumber, from which some amendment was augured
by the physicians, although it might partly be
ascribed to the fatigue induced by the over-excitement
he had undergone a few hours previously in
the performance of the last act of the chequered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
drama of his existence—his retractation; an act
which, after having been visited with praise and
blame, with scorn or admiration, and each in an
exaggerated degree, must for ever remain a mystery.
It must have cost him much—those alone
who were about him at the moment can tell how
much—for he well knew that the eyes of all parties
would be turned upon him, and that his motives
would be discussed under various considerations,
according as the opinions or the interests of each
were concerned: for there were many from whom
praise was to him more bitter than blame, or even
ridicule, from others; and he knew well that none
would view this step in its proper light, as a sacrifice
small in itself—important only because it was
the last, the sacrifice of every feeling, of every consideration,
to the power to which he had taught
every sentiment to bend for so many years, until it
was said that all had been crushed by the mighty
giant,—that love, revenge, even ambition, that all-absorbing
passion of the master mind, had been
led captive or perished in the struggle with his
reason!</p>

<p>A report has gone abroad of his having been
tormented and persecuted, even on his death-bed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
to execute this deed. This is, however, far from
the truth: it had for some time occupied his
thoughts, and among his papers have been found
many proofs; amongst others, fragments of a correspondence
with the Pope upon the subject, which
must necessarily tend to confirm the assertion.
But the fact is, he was influenced in this measure,
as in many other instances wherein he has drawn
down the blame of the sticklers for consistency, by
the desire to spare pain and trouble to his family:
he knew that his relatives would suffer much inconvenience
by his resistance on his death-bed to the
execution of certain religious formalities, to which,
in his own mind, he attached not the slightest importance;
and whatever may be stated by his enemies
with regard to the cold and calculating policy
which had guided all his actions, it cannot be
denied that he had ever held in view the elevation
and aggrandizement of his family. In this aim he
had never been deterred, neither by dulness, nor
incapacity, nor even by ingratitude; and, as we
have seen, he moreover made it his care beyond
the grave: his powerful and passionless soul rejected
all the petty sentiments which actuate men
of ordinary character: he was governed by his
reason alone, and listened to nought beside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
The slumber, or rather lethargy, into which the
Prince had fallen, had continued for about an hour
after my arrival, and it was curious to observe, as
time drew on, the uneasiness which was manifested,
even, alas! by those nearest and dearest, lest this
repose, however salutary, should endure beyond the
hour fixed by the king for his visit. It was with
some difficulty that he was aroused from this oblivion,
and made to comprehend the importance of
the event which was about to occur. He was
scarcely lifted from his reclining position and seated
on the edge of the bed, when, punctual as the hand
upon the dial, his majesty, followed by Madame
Adelaide, entered the apartment. It was a study
both for the moralist and painter to observe the
contrast between these two individuals, as, seated
thus side by side, beneath the canopy of those old
green curtains, they seemed grouped as for the composition
of some historical picture. It was startling
to turn from the broad, expansive forehead, the
calm and stoic brow, and the long and shaggy
locks which overshadowed it, giving to the dying
statesman that lion-like expression of countenance
which had so often formed the theme of admiration
to poets and to artists, and then to gaze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
upon the pointed crown, well-arranged <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">toupée</i>, the
whole outward bearing, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tant soit peu bourgeois</i>,
of the king, who, even at this early hour of the
morning, was attired, according to his custom, with
the utmost precision and primness. Despite the
old faded dressing-gown of the one, and the snuff-coloured
coat, stiff neckcloth, and polished boots
of the other, the veriest barbarian could have told
at a glance which was the “last of the nobles,” and
which the “First Citizen” of the empire. His majesty
was the first to break silence, as in etiquette
bound to do. It would be difficult to define the
expression which passed across his features as he
contemplated what might be called the setting of
his guiding-star. Perhaps he could not himself
have rendered an account of the exact impression
which the scene produced upon his mind.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, prince, to see you suffering so
much,” said he, in a low, tremulous voice, rendered
almost inaudible by extreme emotion.</p>

<p>“Sire, you have come to witness the sufferings
of a dying man, and those who love him can have
but one wish, that of seeing them shortly at an end.”</p>

<p>This was uttered in that deep, strong voice so
peculiar to himself, and which age had not had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
power to weaken, nor the approach of death itself
been able to subdue. The effect of the speech,
short as it was, was indescribable,—the pause by
which it was preceded, and the tone of reproach,
calm and bitter, in which it was conveyed,—produced
an impression which will not be soon forgotten
by those who were present.</p>

<p>The royal visit, like all royal visits of an unpleasant
nature, was of the shortest duration possible.
It was evident that his majesty felt it to be
an irksome moment, and that he was at a loss what
countenance to assume; and, after uttering some
expressions of consolation, he rose to take his
leave, but too visibly pleased that the self-imposed
task was at an end. Here the prince once more,
with his usual tact, came to his relief, by slightly
rising and introducing to his notice those by whom
he was surrounded,—his physician, his secretary, his
principal valet, and his own private doctor; and
then a reminiscence of the old courtier seemed to
come across him, for with his parting salutation he
could not forbear a compliment,—“Sire, our house
has received this day an honour worthy to be inscribed
in our annals, and one which my successors
will remember with pride and gratitude.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
I must confess that I was grievously disappointed
in the anticipations which I had formed of this
visit. I had looked upon it as the farewell of the
safely-landed voyager (landed, too, amid storm and
tempest) to the wise and careful pilot who had
steered him skilfully through rock and breaker, and
now pushed off, alone, amid the darkness, to be seen
no more. But no: there was the hurry and impatience
of one to whom the scene was painful; and
that it was painful who can doubt? There was,
too, that evident secret self-applause, in the performance
of an irksome duty; but not the slightest
expression of any one sentiment of friendship or
attachment, such as I had imagined to have bound
these two men together. A friend of mine—a man
of great sense and discernment—to whom I made
this observation, remarked, drily, “It is plain that
his majesty has no fear to see him die; but wait a
little while, and we shall see that he will have regret
enough that he should be dead!”</p>

<p>As a kind of relief to the gloomy side of the picture,
might be observed the anxious feminine flurry
displayed throughout the interview by Madame, who
appeared to suffer much uneasiness lest the coldness
of her royal brother should be noticed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
who endeavoured, by a kindly display of interest
and busy politeness, to make amends for what
might appear wanting elsewhere.</p>

<p>I should not perhaps have deemed it necessary
to record thus minutely the particular details of this
scene, had not it already been so much dwelt upon in
another light. Astonishment and admiration, frivolous
and exaggerated, have been expressed with
regard to this remarkable act of condescension on
the part of Louis Philippe, as though royalty were
alone exempt from the debt of manly and honourable
gratitude. Why, there is not one of the sovereigns
beneath whom Talleyrand had lived, who
would not have hurried to show respect to the death-bed
of this truly great statesman; and yet all had
not been raised to the throne by his means! Napoleon,
the stern—the iron-hearted—even he would
not have hesitated, because he scorned not to
avow that he had owed as much of his political
success to the timely counsels of his minister for
foreign affairs as to his own skill and foresight.
Louis Dixhuit—neither would he have deemed such
a step beneath his dignity: he, too, needed no
reminding that he was deeply indebted to the Prince
de Talleyrand, not perhaps for zeal and activity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
but for what, according to time and circumstance,
was to him of far more value—his wise, discreet,
and generous forbearance: while Charles X. would
have come, with pious resignation, to mourn the
quenching of this last beacon of the old French
aristocracy, and would have rejoiced that by his
means it should have been extinguished amid becoming
dignity and honour.</p>

<p>It was shortly after the departure of the king that
the first symptoms of dissolution were observed by
the physicians. The whole family, every member
of which had been apprised of this, immediately
gathered around the prince. The Duke de P——
was there among the number, and I could not forbear
a smile as I remembered the satirical observation
made by the prince himself, a short time before
his illness, upon the occasion of rather a ceremonious
visit from this personage,—“Just leaves
me in disappointment,” said he, as he departed;
“one would think, by his melancholy visage and
his lugubrious costume, that he was deputed hither
by some <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrepreneur des pompes funèbres</i>.”</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the day, the prince began
to grow more restless and feverish. I could not
resist the temptation of seeking relief from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
stifled air of that close chamber, and passed
through to the drawing-room. I was verily astounded
at the scene which there met my eyes.
Never shall I forget the impression produced by
the transition from that silent room—that bed of
suffering—to the crowded apartment where “troops
of friends”—all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of the society of Paris—were
assembled. There was a knot of busy politicians,
with ribbons at their button-holes—some
with powdered heads, some with bald heads—gathered
around the blazing fire; their animated
conversation, although, by the good taste and feeling
of him who directed it, conducted in a low
tone, filling the apartment with its unceasing murmur.
I observed, too, some of the diplomatist’s
oldest friends, who had come hither from real and
sincere attachment, and who took no part in the
eager debates of these political champions.</p>

<p>Among others the Count de M——, he whom I
had never seen but as the prime wit of all joyous
réunions—whose pungent joke and biting sarcasm
have become the terror of bores and twaddlers,
for they cling for ever, like burrs, to those against
whom they are hurled:—the only man, in short,
with whom the prince himself dared not, upon all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
occasions, to measure himself in the keen skirmish
of intellect, now sat silent and sorrowful,
apart from the rest, apparently lost in thought,
nor heeding the various details of the scene which
was enacting around him, and which, had it been
elsewhere, would not have failed to call forth some
of the sharp and bitter traits of satire for which
he is so much dreaded. In one corner was seated
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coterie</i> of ladies discussing topics entirely foreign
to the time and place. Sometimes a low burst
of light laughter would issue from among them, in
spite of the reprimanding “Chut” which upon
such occasions arose from the further end of the
room. On a sofa near the window lay extended,
at full length, the youthful and lovely Duchess
de V——, with a bevy of young beaux—all robber-like
and “jeune France,” kneeling on the
carpet beside her, or sitting low at her feet on the
cushions of the divan.</p>

<p>The scene was altogether one of other times.
It seemed as though the lapse of centuries might
be forgotten, and that we were carried back at a
bound to the days of Louis Quatorze, and to the
death-bed of Mazarin. There was the same <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">insouciance</i>,
the same weariness of expectation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Some were gathered there from <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">convénance</i>, some
from courtesy to the rest of the family; many
from curiosity, and some few from real friendship;
while none seemed to remember that a mighty
spirit was passing from the world, or that they were
there assembled to behold a great man die. Presently,
however, the conversation ceased—the hum
of voices was at an end—there was a solemn
pause, and every eye was turned towards the
slowly-opening door of the prince’s chamber. A
domestic entered with downcast looks and swollen
eyes, and advancing towards Dr. C——, who, like
myself, had just then sought an instant’s relief in
the drawing-room, whispered a few words in his
ear. He arose instantly and entered the chamber.
The natural precipitation with which this movement
was executed but too plainly revealed its
cause. It was followed by the whole assembly.
In an instant every one was on the alert, and there
was a simultaneous rush to the door of the apartment.
M. de Talleyrand was at that moment
seated on the side of the bed, supported in the
arms of his secretary. It was evident that Death
had set his seal upon that marble brow, yet was I
struck with the still-existing vigour of the countenance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
It seemed as if all the life which had
once sufficed to furnish forth the whole being
were now centred in the brain. From time to
time he raised his head, with a sudden movement
shaking back the long, grey locks which impeded
his sight, and gazed around; and then, satisfied
with the result of his examination of that crowded
room, a triumphant smile would pass across his
features, and his head would again fall upon his
bosom.</p>

<p>From the circumstances in which I have been
placed, it has fallen to my lot to be witness of
more than one death-scene, but never in any case
did the sentiments displayed at that awful hour
appear so utterly consistent with the character
borne by any individual during life, as in the case
of the Prince de Talleyrand. He saw death approach
neither with shrinking nor with fear, nor
yet with any affectation of scorn or of defiance,
but rather with cool and steady courage, as a well-matched,
honourable foe with whom he had wrestled
long and bravely, and to whom, now that he was
fairly vanquished, he deemed it no shame to yield,
nor blushed to lay down his arms and surrender.
If there be truth in the assertion that it is a satisfaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
to die amid the tears and lamentations of
multitudes of friends and hosts of relatives, then
indeed must his last feeling towards the world he
was for ever quitting have been one of entire approbation
and content, for he expired amid regal
pomp and reverence; and of all those whom he,
perhaps, would himself have called together, none
were wanting. The aged friend of his maturity,
the fair young idol of his age, were gathered on
bended knee beside his bed, and if the words of
comfort whispered from the book by the murmuring
priest failed to reach his ear, it was because
their sound was stifled by the louder wailings of
those whom in life he had loved so well.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, were those eyes, whose every
glance had been watched so long and with such
deep interest, for ever closed, when a sudden
change came over the scene. One would have
thought that a flight of crows had suddenly taken
wing, so great was the precipitation with which
each one hurried from the hotel, in the hope of
being first to spread the news among the particular
set or coterie of which he or she happened to be
the oracle. Ere nightfall, that chamber, which all
the day had been crowded to excess, was abandoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
to the servants of the tomb; and when I
entered in the evening, I found the very arm-chair,
from whence I had so often heard the prince
launch the courtly jest or stinging epigram, now
occupied by a hired priest, whispering prayers for
the repose of his departed soul.</p>

<p>It was after the death of the prince that the awe
and devotion with which he had inspired his household
became evident. Not one of the domestics
left his station upon any pretext whatever. The
attendants waited, each in his turn, and at the
same stated hour, to which he had been accustomed
during his life. I myself saw the cook, punctual
to the hour in the morning at which he had for so
many years been summoned to receive his orders,
now followed by his bevy of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marmitons</i>, with their
snow-white costumes and long carving-knives, walk
with solemn step to the foot of the bed, and,
kneeling down with cotton cap in hand, breathe a
short prayer: each sprinkled the corpse with holy
water, and then the whole procession withdrew in
the same silence with which they had entered. I
was deeply struck with the mixture of the sublime
and the ludicrous in this scene. It reminded me
of many of the whimsical creations to be met with
in some of the old German legends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Contrary to the usual French custom, which
ordains that interment shall ensue eight-and-forty
hours after decease, the public funeral, upon
the occasion of the depositing of the body in the
church of the Assumption, did not take place
until the following week, owing to the embalmment,
which was a work of time; while the transferring
of the corpse to its final resting-place at
Valençay could not be accomplished until the
month of September, the vault, which was preparing
even before the Prince’s death, being yet
unfinished.</p>

<p>Independently of the interest which I felt in
the ceremony, as well as the desire to render this
last homage to one who had, upon every occasion
of my intercourse with him, been all kindness and
urbanity to me, I determined to repair to Valençay
and witness the funerals—for at one fell stroke
had death swept from the earth all that remained
of that one generation. The Prince de Talleyrand—the
wise, the witty, the clever, and the cunning—was
to go down to the grave with the guileless
and the simple-hearted Duke, his brother!
Upon the same occasion, too, the small tomb of
the infant Yolande, wherein she had peacefully
slumbered for a space of two years, was routed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
and the tiny coffin was to accompany that of the
Prince on its long and dreary journey. The
hearse which was to convey the bodies was the
same which had been constructed expressly for the
removal of the corpse of the ex-Queen of Holland
from Switzerland, in appearance something resembling
an ammunition-waggon, with covered seats
in front, wherein were stationed two of the personal
attendants of the Prince. The body was raised
from the vaults of the Assumption at midnight,
and the little snow-white coffin was placed upon
the elaborately-wrought oaken chest which had
contained it.</p>

<p>I was told by a friend, who witnessed the scene,
that nothing could exceed the dramatic effect
of the departure of the corpse-laden vehicle from
Paris. The disinterment of the child from the
lonely cemetery of Mont Parnasse—the lading of
the ponderous coffin by the light of torches—the
peculiar rattle of the hearse through the silent
streets at that solemn hour, and beneath that calm
moon, which makes “all that is dark seem darker
still.” One incident is worth recording. On
starting from the iron gates of the chapel, one of
the postillions turned and shouted the usual question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vers quelle barrière?</i>” and was answered
by a voice proceeding from the hearse itself, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Barrière
d’Enfer</i>.”</p>

<p>We arrived at Valençay on the third day after
our departure from Paris, and it was at about ten
o’clock on the same night that the worn and dust-covered
hearse was descried wending its way up
the long avenue of chestnut trees leading to the
château. Every honour which had been paid to
the lord of the mansion during his life was now
rendered, with scrupulous exactness, to his lifeless
corpse. No ceremony, however trifling, was omitted.
The wide gates were thrown open to admit
the sombre vehicle, which entered the court of
honour with the same ceremony that had denoted
the approach of the stately carriage which had been
wont to drive at a somewhat ruder pace through
the regal portal. The whole of the numerous
household, with the heir of the domain in advance
of the rest, were assembled on the perron. The
Prince’s nephew himself took his seat in front of
the hearse, to conduct it down into the town;
the goodly array of servants and huntsmen and
foresters all following on foot, and bearing torches,
to the church, wherein the body was deposited for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
the night, previous to the final ceremony, which
was to take place on the morrow.</p>

<p>Early in the morning all was astir in the little
burgh. Never before had a sight so fraught with
interest been witnessed by its inhabitants. It
seemed like a gala day through every street. Not
a window but was crowded with spectators, while
the footway was choked with peasants from all the
neighbouring districts, in their gayest attire. The
National Guard of the town was all afoot from the
earliest hour in the morning; and altogether so
cheerful was the whole aspect of the place, that
the traveller who had passed through on that day
would have imagined it to have been the anniversary
of some great public rejoicing. The corpse
of the Duke had arrived in far different plight.
No pomp, no pageantry, was here—a solitary post-carriage,
with a single pair of horses—no train of
mourners. The physician who had attended his
last illness alone accompanied the body from St.
Germain.</p>

<p>There was food for reflection in the contrast!
No needless expense had been wasted upon idle
ornament and funeral trappings, for, when the
coffin was uncovered, an exclamation of surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
burst from those around. It was of plain elm,
such as those used by people of middling degree,
and, when placed beside those of his more favoured
relatives, formed a melancholy contrast.
But now one pall conceals the whole, the rich
velvet, and the plain, unvarnished planks. One
long stream of melody ascends to Heaven, one
prayer for the repose of those who sleep beneath
that gorgeous catafalque—for him who died full of
wealth and honour, whose vast and powerful intellect
had held dominion over men’s minds even
to the very last—and for him who closed his
eyes in solitude and neglect, and whose intellect
had wavered even on the very verge of madness.
Both were transported to the chapel of the sisters
of St. André, founded by the Prince himself, and
wherein he had already placed the family vault.
His body was the first to descend, amid the firing
of muskets, and the noisy demonstrations of respect
of those without: then that of the Duke,
amid silence unbroken, save by the harsh creaking
of the coffin, as it slid down the iron grating:
then, last and least, although the oldest denizen
of the tomb, the little Yolande, the fairy coffin
seeming, with its silver chasings and embossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
velvet, of snowy whiteness, rather a casket destined
to ornament the boudoir of a youthful beauty,
than to become a receptacle of corruption and
decay.</p>

<p>The vault was closed, and all was over. Each
one had contributed the last token of Catholic
respect, and we all turned from the chapel to
take the road to the château, where entertainment
for those who attended the funeral had been liberally
prepared by its new master. It was then
that we began to look around, and to feel some
curiosity to know who had shared with us in rendering
this last homage to one who was entitled to
the gratitude of every individual of his nation.
We gazed right and left, but few were there, and
these were <em>all</em> those who had <em>served him</em> devotedly
and faithfully—the grateful domestic, the obscure
and humble friend; but of the great ones of the
earth whom <em>he had served</em>—of those whom <em>he</em> had
raised to greatness and to honour—there was not
<span class="smcap smaller">ONE</span>!</p>

PRINCE TALLEYRAND’S<br />
<span class="larger">MAXIMS FOR SEASONING CONVERSATION.</span>
</h3>

<p>Our welcome of a stranger depends upon the
name he bears,—upon the coat he wears: our farewell
upon the spirit he has displayed in the interview.</p>

<p>There is so great a charm in friendship, that
there is even a kind of pleasure in acknowledging
oneself duped by the sentiment it inspires.</p>

<p>Unbounded modesty is nothing more than unavowed
vanity: the too humble obeisance is sometimes
a disguised impertinence.</p>

<p>The reputation of a man is like his shadow—gigantic
when it precedes him, and pigmy in its
proportions when it follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
The “point of honour” can often be made to
produce, by means of vanity, as many good deeds
as virtue.</p>

<p>More evil truths are discovered by the corruption
of the heart than by the penetration of the
mind.</p>

<p>Beauty, devoid of grace, is a mere hook without
the bait.</p>

<p>Schismatic wranglers are like a child’s top,
noisy and agitated when whipped, quiet and motionless
when left alone.</p>

<p>He who cannot feel friendship is alike incapable
of love. Let a woman beware of the man who
owns that he loves no one but herself.</p>

<p>The rich man despises those who flatter him too
much, and hates those who do not flatter him at all.</p>

<p>The spirit and enterprise of a courtier are all
expended in the search after place and preferment;
nothing remains for the fulfilment of the duties to
which success compels him.</p>

<p>The Count de Coigny possesses wit and talent,
but his conversation is fatiguing, because his memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
is equally exact in quoting the date of the
death of Alexander the Great and that of the
Princess de Guéménée’s poodle.</p>

<p>My passion for Madame de Talleyrand was soon
extinguished, because she was merely possessed of
beauty. The influence of personal charms is limited:
curiosity forms the great ingredient of this kind of
love; but add the fascination of intellect to those attractions
which habit and possession diminish each
day, you will find them multiplied tenfold; and if,
besides intellect and beauty, you discover in your
mistress caprice, singularity, and inequality of
temper, close your eyes and seek no further—you
are in love for life.</p>

<p>The imagination of men is often the refuge of
their prejudices.</p>

<p>To contradict and argue with a total stranger, is
like knocking at a gate to ascertain if there is any
one within.</p>

<p>That sovereign has a little mind who seeks to go
down to posterity by means of great public buildings.
It is to confide to masons and bricklayers
the task of writing History.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Love is a reality which is born in the fairy region
of romance.</p>

<p>The love of glory can only create a hero; the
contempt of it creates a great man.</p>

<p>The mind of the Duc de Laval is like a dark
lanthorn, only capable of lighting his own path.</p>

<p>The errors of great men, and the good deeds of
reprobates, should not be reckoned in our estimates
of their respective characters.</p>

<p>A court is an assemblage of noble and distinguished
beggars.</p>

<p>Theologians resemble dogs, that gnaw large
bones for the sake of a very little meat.</p>

<p>The stream of vice will flow as naturally into
palaces, as the common sewer flows into the river,
and the river flows onward to the sea.</p>

<p>It is sometimes quite enough for a man to feign
ignorance of that which he knows, to gain the reputation
of knowing that of which he is ignorant.</p>

<p>A long continuance of wise administration is the
best and surest means of arriving at despotism.
Our present government gives us no alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
Both erudition and agriculture ought to be encouraged
by government; wit and manufactures
will come of themselves.</p>

<p>The endeavour to convince a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bel esprit</i> by the
force of reason, is as mad an undertaking as the
attempt to silence an echo by raising the voice.</p>

<p>Metaphysics always remind me of the caravanserais
in the desert. They stand solitary and
unsupported, and are therefore always ready to
crumble into ruin.</p>

<p>A man should make his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">début</i> in the world as
though he were about to enter a hostile country;
he must send out scouts, establish sentinels, and
ever be upon the watch himself.</p>

<p>Too much sensibility creates unhappiness; too
much insensibility creates crime.</p>

<p>What I have been taught, I have forgotten; what
I know, I have guessed.</p>

<p>An elderly coxcomb may be compared to a
butterfly deprived of wings—he becomes a caterpillar
once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Certain acts may be rendered legal; but can
never be made legitimate.</p>

<p>Human life is like a game at chess; each piece
holds its place upon the chess-board—king,
queen, bishop, and pawn. Death comes, the game
is up, and all are thrown, without distinction, pell-mell
into the same bag.</p>

<p>The bold defiance of a woman is the certain
sign of her shame—when she has once ceased to
blush, it is because she has too much to blush for.</p>

<p>Life, to a young man, is like a new acquaintance,
of whom he grows disgusted as he advances in
years.</p>

<p>When certain absurd opinions become too generally
adopted, they must be replaced by less
noxious errors—that is the best way of arriving at
Truth.</p>

<p>It is an attribute of true philosophy, never to force
the progress of Truth and Reason, but to wait till
the dawn of Light; meanwhile, the philosopher may
wander into hidden paths, but he will never depart
far from the main track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
Prudence in a woman should be an instinct, not
a virtue.</p>

<p>Churchmen and men of letters have peculiar
difficulties in the world,—the first are continually
divided between scandal and hypocrisy, the second
between pride and baseness.</p>

<p>The thought of death throws upon life a lurid
glow, resembling that of a conflagration, lighting
up that which it is about to devour.</p>

<p>In love we grow acquainted, because we are
already attached—in friendship we must know each
other before we love.</p>

<p>A great capitalist is like a vast lake, upon whose
bosom ships can navigate, but which is useless to
the country, because no stream issues thence to
fertilize the land.</p>

<p>With a great seigneur, there is more to be gained
by flattering his vices than by improving his
estates.</p>

<p>Truth and virtue can do less good in the world
than their false, well-acted semblance can do evil.</p>

<p>A generous man will place the benefits he confers
beneath his feet,—those he receives, nearest his
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
A narrow-minded man can never possess real
and true generosity—he can never go beyond mere
benevolence.</p>

<p>General maxims applied to every-day life are
like routine applied to the arts, good only for
mediocre intellects.</p>

<p>If you wish to appear agreeable in society, you
must consent to be taught many things which you
know already.</p>

<p>We must learn to submit with grace to commit
the follies which depend upon character.</p>

<p>There are many vices which do not deprive us
of friends,—there are many virtues which prevent
our having any.</p>

<p>In reading over the memoirs of the reign of
Louis Quatorze, we find many things in the worst
manners of that day, which are wanting in the very
best society of our own.</p>

<p>I remember having, in my youth, been amused
at the resolution of one of my friends to give up
the society of the demoiselles de l’opéra, to which
he was much addicted, in consequence of his
having made the discovery that there existed among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
these girls as much falsehood and hypocrisy as
amongst honest women.</p>

<p>Certain women can find buyers for their charms,
who would find no one to take them were they to
be had for nothing.</p>

<p>I remember having often been told in my youth
that the love of glory was a virtue. Strange must
be that virtue which requires the aid of every vice.</p>

<p>There are two things to which we never grow
accustomed,—the ravages of time, and the injustice
of our fellow men.</p>

<p>The written memoirs which a man leaves after
him <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour servir à l’histoire de sa vie</i>, and above all,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour servir à l’histoire</i> of his vanity, always remind
me of the story of that saint, who left by will
a hundred thousand crowns to the Church, to pay
for his canonization.</p>

<p>To succeed in the world, it is much more necessary
to possess the penetration to discover who is a
fool than to discover who is a clever man.</p>

<h3 id="fox">PRINCE TALLEYRAND’S OPINION OF FOX.</h3>

<p class="center b1">(<i>A Fragment from the Prince’s Memoirs.</i>)</p>

<p class="sigright">January 15th, 1807.</p>

<p>I have just heard of the death of Mr. Fox. It
is now fifteen years since I was introduced to him
by Mr. Ogilvie, the husband of his aunt, the
Duchess of Leinster. It was at his own house, in
South-street, and, I think, in June, 1791.</p>

<p>Shortly before his death, false reports led him to
form an unjust opinion of me; yet my regret for
his loss is not the less deep and sincere, and I
feel a firm conviction that, had his life been spared,
he would have rendered me justice.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox united in his own character the apparently
incompatible qualities of the mildest of men,
and the most vehement of orators. In private life he
was gentle, modest, kind-hearted, and remarkably
simple in his manners. His dislike of ostentation,
and of any approach to dogmatism, sometimes
gave to his conversation an air of listlessness; his
superiority was manifested only by the information
he diffused around him, and by the generous feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
which always prompted him to direct the greatest
share of his attention to the most obscure members
of the company in which he happened to be. The
simplicity of his manners did not, in the least, detract
from that urbanity, and perfect politeness,
which resulted more from the gentleness of his
nature, than from his familiar intercourse with the
most polished society of Europe. His conversation,
when not restrained by the languor arising
from fatigue, or by his delicacy towards others,
was truly charming. It may, perhaps, be said,
that never was the pleasantry of a man of wit so
perfectly natural, as that of Mr. Fox; it seemed
more like the outpouring, than the creation, of his
fancy. He had lived on terms of close intimacy
with all those of his contemporaries most distinguished
for talent, learning, and political eminence.
For the space of thirty years, he maintained intercourse
with almost every man in Europe whose
conversation and correspondence were of a nature to
fortify, enrich, or polish the intellectual faculties.
His own literary attainments were varied and
profound. In classical erudition, which in England
is specially understood by the term learning,
he was not inferior to some of the most distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
scholars of his day. Like all men of genius, he
was passionately fond of poetry; the study and
cultivation of that branch of literature, formed his
favourite source of recreation, amidst the fatigues
and annoyances of public life. His own poetic
effusions were easy and agreeable, and deserving of
a high place in that class of writing which the
French call <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vers de société</i>. The character of his
mind was manifested in his predilection for the
poetry of the two most poetic nations (or at least
most poetic languages) of eastern Europe, viz., the
ancient Greek and the modern Italian. Fox did
not like political discussions in conversation, and
he never voluntarily took part in them.</p>

<p>Any attempt to render justice to his oratorical
talents would carry me far beyond the limits of
these brief remarks. He was always, and everywhere,
natural; and, in public, his manner and
appearance were stamped with much of the simplicity
which characterized him in private life.
When he began to speak, an ordinary observer
would have supposed him to be labouring under
embarrassment, and even a discriminating listener
would only have been struck by the just accuracy
of his ideas, and the lucid simplicity of his language;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
but, after speaking for some time, he was
transformed into another being. He forgot himself,
and everything around him. His thoughts
were wholly absorbed in his subject. His genius
warmed as he advanced, and his sentences flashed
like rays of light; until at length, in an impetuous
and irresistible torrent of eloquence, he earned
along with him the feelings and the conviction of
his hearers. Fox certainly possessed, beyond any
public speaker of modern times, that union of
reasoning power, of simplicity, and of vehemence,
which characterizes the prince of orators. Next to
Demosthenes, he was the most Demosthenian of
public speakers. “I knew him,” observes Mr.
Burke, in a pamphlet written after their unfortunate
difference, “when he was only nineteen years
old. From that time he continued rising, by slow
degrees, until he has now become the most brilliant
and accomplished debater that ever lived.”</p>

<p>The tranquil dignity of mind, (never disturbed
but by great causes)—the total absence of vanity—the
contempt of ostentation—the hatred of intrigue—the
candour, the honesty, and the perfect <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonhomie</i>,
which were the distinguishing qualities of
Fox, would seem to render him the faithful representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
of the old national English character—a
character which it would be presumptuous to hope
can be succeeded by anything better, were it ever
to change. The amiability of his disposition inspired
confidence—the ardour of his eloquence
excited enthusiasm—and the urbanity of his manners
invited friendship. Mr. Gibbon has truly
observed, that in Fox the highest intellectual powers
of man were blended with the engaging gentleness
and simplicity of childhood. No human
being, he adds, was ever more free from every
trace of malignity, vanity, or falsehood. The combination
of so many admirable qualities of public
and private character, sufficiently accounts for the
fact that no English statesman, during so long a
period of adverse fortune, retained so many attached
friends and zealous adherents, as Charles
Fox. The union of great ardour, in the sentiments
of the public man, with extreme gentleness
in the manners of the social being, would appear
to have been an hereditary qualification in Fox,
whose father is said to have possessed the same
power of winning the attachment of all who
knew him. Those who are acquainted with
another generation of his descendants, must feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
that this engaging quality is not extinct in the
family.</p>

<p>Nothing, perhaps, can more forcibly portray
the impression produced by this peculiarity in the
character of Fox, than a remark made by Burke.
In 1797, six years after all intimacy between
Burke and Fox had ceased, the former, speaking
to an individual honoured by the friendship of the
latter, said, “Certainly, Fox is a man formed to be
loved;” and these words were uttered with a warmth
and emphasis, which precluded all doubt of their
cordial sincerity.</p>

<p>The few lines I have here hastily traced, have
been written under feelings too sorrowful and serious
to admit of any intention to exaggerate; and
the affection which I cherished for Mr. Fox will
not suffer me to profane his memory by any allusion
to the factious contentions of the day. The
political conduct of Fox belongs to history. The
measures he supported, and those he opposed, may
divide the opinions of posterity, as they have those
of the present age; but Charles Fox will, assuredly,
command the unanimous respect of future generations,
by his pure sentiments as a statesman—by
his zeal for the civil and religious rights of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
mankind—by his advocacy of liberal government,
the free exercise of human faculties, and the progressive
civilization of the human race—by the
ardent love he cherished for his country, whose
welfare and happiness can never be disconnected
from his glory—and by his profound veneration
for that free constitution, which, it will be acknowledged,
he understood better than any politician of
his time, both in its legal and in its philosophical
character.</p>

<h3 id="sebastiani1">PRIVATE LETTER FROM PRINCE TALLEYRAND TO
MARSHAL SEBASTIANI, ON THE POLICY OF SUFFERING
BELGIUM TO BE CREATED AN INDEPENDENT
MONARCHY.</h3>

<p class="sigright">London, January 3rd, 1831.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,—I have read over several
times, with the utmost attention, your letter of the
30th ult., and I wish to explain to you confidentially
my views relative to its contents. It is evident
that, at the present time, France is divided between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
two parties, whose opinions have their echoes in
the council of the king. One of these parties
urges us to war, and employs every means, direct
and indirect, to bring about that end. The views
of this party are directed solely to the attainment
of power, and therefore it is necessary to be on
one’s guard against the suggestions and speeches
which they put forth. The other party, which is
so ably headed by yourself, maintains that peace
alone can consolidate the new state of things in
France, and, consequently, it may be presumed
that all its efforts tend to the preservation of peace.
It has been truly observed, that a kingdom may
rise up amidst the turmoil of war, but that it can
only be firmly established in time of peace.</p>

<p>The new line of policy which you suggest in reference
to the affairs of Belgium is at variance
with all my ideas on the subject, and it would, I
am sure, be equally opposed to the views of the
English ministers and the members of the conference.
Of this fact I have had opportunities of
convincing myself in the course of several conversations
I have casually entered into for the purpose
of sounding opinions on the subject.</p>

<p>We might succeed, but not without difficulty, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
obtaining the sovereignty of Belgium for Prince
Leopold, on his marriage with a French princess;
and I cannot comprehend how the speeches of
certain members of the party decidedly favourable
to war, should have determined you to renounce
the only arrangement by which peace can now be
secured.</p>

<p>It must be evident to you, as it is to me, that
Prince Leopold is very far from being what is called
English. He is attached to England only by the
50,000<i>l.</i> per annum, of which he cannot be deprived,
and which gives him the advantage of presenting
a civil list, ready settled, to the country he
may be called to rule.</p>

<p>Like all great political events, the Belgian revolution
appears to me to pass through different
phases. The establishment of a monarchical
government in Belgium seems a step calculated to
relieve that country from the embarrassments in
which she is enthralled—viz., the division of the
debt between Belgium and Holland; the debt contracted
by Belgium to Russia; together with many
other matters connected with Belgian independence.</p>

<p>When all these questions shall be adjusted, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Europe shall have approved the adjustment, we
may, after the lapse of a few years, entertain with
some hope of success, the project of uniting Belgium
to France. The very adjustment of the
points above referred to, would favour the chance
of success, because it would remove difficulties
which every one is capable of appreciating. But
I am convinced that war would be the inevitable
consequence of the proposition now made for annexing
Belgium to France.</p>

<p>The present spirit of the members of the conference,
and of the English Cabinet, is extremely
favourable to us; but, my dear General, I affirm,
in the full confidence of being correct, that if we
were suspected of entertaining other intentions
than those which I have deemed it expedient to
express, our position with reference to all the
Courts of Europe, including that of England,
would be changed much to our disadvantage.</p>

<p>I entreat you, therefore, to reflect maturely before
you enter upon so perilous a course. War
may compromise so many questions, that it appears
to me of all things most to be feared and avoided.
The wisdom of the king, who well knows how to
resist party clamour, and your prudence, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
General, must avert this misfortune, and control
the turbulent spirits who would drive us to extremities,
unmindful that the glory of France now
depends on peace. It is easy to commence war,—the
difficulty is how to maintain and to terminate
it. In short, I am averse to the project of the acquisition
of Belgium. The aggrandizement of
France by that acquisition would doubtless be
flattering to French vanity, but it would in many
respects be injurious to French industry. The
case is different with respect to the Rhine and
Saxony. But, General, your position enables you
to judge more accurately than I can, the various
questions adverted to in this letter.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="sebastiani2">FROM PRINCE TALLEYRAND TO MARSHAL SEBASTIANI,
ON THE SAME SUBJECT AS THE PRECEDING.</h3>

<p>The importance of the crisis at which we have
arrived cannot fail frequently to claim your attention.
At the present juncture we may, by prompt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
and honest decision, preserve peace, or by prolonged
hesitation we may enable intriguers (too
numerous a class both here and in Belgium) to
compromise the destinies of Europe, and of the
dynasty which the voice of the nation has raised
to the throne of France. I await with the utmost
anxiety and impatience the reply of the French
Cabinet to the various questions proposed by the
four Powers; the delay of that reply probably causes
indecision in the opinions of the plenipotentiaries
assembled here. For Heaven’s sake let not the
Belgians, who are so stupid as not to perceive all
that has been done for them, and the Dutch, who
are stimulated by bitter hatred, draw us into this
deplorable contest! Let us not suffer an affair,
trivial in itself, to disturb the equilibrium of the
world, and to unbridle the fiercest passions. All
will be ended, all consummated on the day when
France, conjointly with the four other Powers, shall
declare that Belgium is to retain her <em>old boundaries,
her independence, and her neutrality</em>. On that
day the Dutch will be paralysed, the Germanic
Confederation will halt, the Belgians will be subdued,
the conference will choose Prince Leopold
for king, and peace will be secured. If France be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
so blind as to censure your administration for
having saved her in spite of herself—if she be
unjust to those who have preserved her—then, sir,
you will cease to be minister, and I shall cease to
be ambassador. We shall forfeit our posts for
having defended and maintained a great principle,
for which future ages will honour us. In short, we
may be sacrificed, but let it be in the cause of
peace, in the cause of civilization and of good
order, and in defence of a sovereign whom we love,
and whose throne will fall in the general destruction
now impending. There is but little time for
averting the terrible disaster which my old experience
foresees, and of which your quick and accurate
discernment must have enabled you to warn
the council. But, sir, let your decisions be formed
singly with yourself. The powers of the clearest
head, and soundest judgment, cannot be freely
exercised except when withdrawn from the turbulence
of one party, the timidity of another, and
unbiassed by the ignorance of outward affairs
which is so marked a trait in the French character.
The intelligence of the French people, shrewd as
it is, scarcely ever extends beyond the frontiers
of their own country, and therefore they labour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
under the singular mistake of supposing that
England cannot go to war with us. They do not
perceive that the vast concession made by the recent
Reform Bill has conferred on the English
ministry a temporary popularity, of which they will
freely avail themselves to obtain the means of opposing
us; and that this means will be much more
readily accorded to the present administration than
it would have been to that of the Duke of Wellington.
Our July revolution is tarnished by circumstances
which have greatly obscured its lustre; and
it has been justly observed that anarchy and disorder
are not very formidable ramparts to be opposed
to an enemy. However, there appears to be
no disposition to attack us, more especially since
the questions of right and law have been entrusted
to you. But whenever we give reason to warrant
suspicions of our good faith, or of our capability
to repress turbulent movements, then, rest assured,
that England will, though reluctantly, oppose us
with an immensity and a facility of power at
which France will be astounded.</p>

<p>On the other hand all that is required of us is to
be firm at home and moderate abroad. There is
no intention to take anything from us; on the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
many concessions on the part of neighbouring
powers have been assented to. But it is wished
to preserve general peace and security, and not to
grant to nations, whose independence has been recognised
in spite of old treaties, the right of conquest
over countries which have never belonged to
them, and which are the guaranteed property of
others. For our own sake, sir, as well as for the
general good, it were to be wished that every individual
composing the French cabinet could comprehend
the principle of <em>non-intervention</em> in the
way in which it was understood by M. de Rigny at
Navarino.</p>

<h3 id="sebastiani3">LETTER FROM PRINCE TALLEYRAND TO COUNT SEBASTIANI,
ON THE AFFAIRS OF BELGIUM.</h3>

<p class="sigright">London, January 25th, 1831.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur le Comte</span>,—Count Flahaut arrived
here the day before yesterday, and delivered to me
the letter which you entrusted to his charge. I
thank you for having chosen him as the bearer
of it.</p>

<p>The raising of the siege of Antwerp, and the irritation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
of the King of Holland, prove that the conference
was sufficiently rigorous towards both
parties to obtain the wished-for result.</p>

<p>My conversation with M. de Flahaut has furnished
me with some valuable information respecting
the ideas and intentions of the king’s government
relative to the affairs which I am directed to
manage here, and also respecting the state of public
opinion in France. I, however, regret that Count
Flahaut had left France before my despatch of the
21st reached you. The intelligence it contained
of the resolution adopted by the conference must
necessarily influence the views of the king and his
council, as well as the line of policy to be pursued
towards Belgium. I congratulate myself on the
declaration of neutrality, which has been received
with great satisfaction by the statesmen of this
country. All, to whatsoever party they belong,
regard it as a measure of wise policy, honourable
to modern civilization, and calculated to ensure
the maintenance of peace by the facility it affords
for conciliating, if not all claims, at least all essential
interests. I must add, however, that whilst
acceding to the measure, they regard it as wholly
tending to the advantage of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
I am aware that, in the juncture at which affairs
have arrived in Belgium, and amidst the embarrassment
which this state of things entails on France
and Europe, the public mind has been agitated by
schemes of the most opposite character. The
avowed neutrality has now rendered most of these
plans utterly impracticable, and has enabled me
to revive, with advantage, the question of the
Prince of Naples, to which, at first, so much opposition
was manifested. I even think that we shall
completely succeed in rendering the city of Antwerp
a free port, or rather in making it one of the
Hanse Towns; and I am not quite certain but that
we may arrive at this result without Antwerp ceasing
to belong, as a free port, to Belgium. From the
day on which the protocol was signed, such is the
line of policy I have pursued, and I shall continue
to follow it up, unless I receive contrary instructions
from you.</p>

<p>This plan has the advantage of showing how
utterly useless would be any concession made to
England on the continent. I will even acknowledge
that it was with the view of banishing any
idea of that nature that I adopted the system I am
now pursuing. I should have deeply regretted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
see the king’s name and yours attached to a clause
which, in my opinion, would render our government
liable to the charge of being indifferent
to the judgment of posterity.</p>

<p>History bears evidence to the difficulties entailed
by the prolonged occupation of Calais by the
English, and it records the favours lavished on the
Guises, when they relieved France from that disgrace.
These lessons ought not to be thrown
away upon us. The same mistakes may be followed
by the same results, and may obliterate the
stamp of independence which is attached to all the
acts of the king’s government. I am certain that
his majesty is too high-minded to dwell long on
the idea of a plan which, without having any direct
effect on our own country, would cause us to be
reproached for the manner in which we have exercised
our continental power.</p>

<p>No one will go so far as to deny that the annexation
of Belgium to France would be an advantage,
though an aggrandizement of territory on the bank
of the Rhine would be more in accordance with my
notions of French policy. I admit that the annexation
of Belgium would render popular, for a
time, the government that might bring it about,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
notwithstanding its injurious effects on French
industry. But you may rely on it, Count, that
that popularity would be exceedingly transient, if
purchased at the price that is proposed to be paid
for it. There is no reputation, however solid, that
would not be shaken by a measure of such a nature.
Does not every one blame the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
for having brought the Russians into
Europe? What a heavy judgment would fall on
those who should bring the English back on the
continent! It is best not to throw ourselves into
contact with those whom we cannot reach on their
own ground.</p>

<p>I am convinced, Monsieur le Comte, if you
were plenipotentiary here, you would never affix
your name to an act which not even the most
protracted and most disastrous war would justify.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Note of M. Colmache.</span>—The Minister for Foreign
Affairs (Count Sebastiani) made no reply to the above severe,
but just comments on the unworthy proposition which Count
Flahaut had undertaken to communicate to the French
embassy.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="guilleminot">OBSERVATIONS ON THE TRIAL OF PEERS BY THE
CHAMBER OF PEERS, AND THE REASONS ON
WHICH TALLEYRAND GROUNDED HIS VOTE IN
THE AFFAIR OF LIEUTENANTS-GENERAL GUILLEMINOT
AND BORDESOULLE.</h3>

<p>Our political laws have existed only during the
space of a few years. We have witnessed their
creation and their birth. As yet they are scarcely
anything more than theories. Time alone will
convert them into practical laws. In other words,
we possess laws, but we do not yet possess jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Amidst all the uncertainties necessarily arising
out of such a state of things, it has appeared to
me that my duty, as a Peer of France, was to seek,
in reflection, for that light and knowledge which
experience cannot afford. The following chain
of ideas has aided me in the accomplishment of
this duty.</p>

<p>The first question I put to myself was, What is
the Court of Peers? The answer is, An extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
tribunal, instituted by the Charter, for
judging certain affairs which that Charter has withdrawn
from the ordinary tribunals, either on account
of the serious nature of the crimes, or by reason of
the rank of the individuals accused. Such, it appears
to me, are the meaning and the spirit of Articles
33 and 34 of our fundamental law.</p>

<p>Is this a wise institution? Is it beneficial to the
country? I would answer in the affirmative. But
these points are not for me to determine. The
Charter has decreed, and that is sufficient.</p>

<p>Now, in what does this extraordinary tribunal
resemble the ordinary tribunals? Can it be tied
down to the same forms of procedure? I find that
the law—the faithful guardian of the interests of
society, whilst it declares that crime must not
escape punishment, is, nevertheless, more watchful
in protecting the innocent than in punishing the
guilty. It has therefore wisely established hierarchical
degrees in the judiciary organization. It
separates the accusation from the judgment, and
even after judgment the condemned is empowered
to appeal for its annulment, if, in the long course of
proceedings, a single one of the prescribed tutelary
forms shall have been violated or disavowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
But in the Court of Peers there are no hierarchic
degrees; there is not, and cannot be, a chamber of
accusation distinct from the court of judgment,
where the accusers are themselves the judges.
When the Court of Peers has pronounced, the
condemned party has no appeal, either on the
score of form or fact. The mercy of the king
alone can save him. The justice of the Court of
Peers is one and indivisible; its action is prompt
and irreformable, and against its decisions there is
no appeal. It must not be supposed that public
feeling rises in alarm against a tribunal which, by
its inflexible rapidity, promptly terminates the most
important affairs. On the contrary, innocence will
always appeal for its protection, and guilt itself will
seek refuge in the august sanctuary. The reason
is, that the guarantee afforded by the tardy forms
of the ordinary courts, is abundantly atoned for by
the vast number of the judges in the Court of Peers—by
the importance attached to their elevated position—and
by the sort of religious awe which takes
possession of them, when, at distant intervals, the
law calls them from the peaceful habits of their
lives, and arms them with the sword of justice.</p>

<p>Thus it is shown that ordinary justice is hierarchical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
and successive, whilst, that of the Peers is indivisible
and instantaneous. Ordinary justice, by
reason of its hierarchical character, is susceptible
of change both in its nature and in its forms; the
justice of the Peers, inasmuch as it is indivisible,
is incapable of change.</p>

<p>But this is not the only difference existing between
ordinary justice and that which the Charter
has confided to our administration. The course
of ordinary justice commences in secrecy and ends
in publicity. Over the proceedings of the Court
of Peers publicity presides, from their commencement
to their close.</p>

<p>When ordinary justice conceives suspicions
against a private individual, it silently takes measures
for repressing the crime or the offence. Even
in cases in which it is deemed necessary to deprive
the accused of his liberty, the accusation may remain
a secret between the magistrate and the accused.
Should the suspicion prove unfounded,
and the accused be restored to liberty by the
Chamber of Accusation, (the first degree in the
judicial hierarchy,) that liberation sufficiently repairs
the injury sustained by personal honour in
the sphere of society to which the accused belongs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
But, gentlemen, is it so when the Peers are called
upon to render justice in the case of any one of
those accused persons whom the law consigns to
their judgment? Is not a discussion in the Chamber
of Peers an important event in itself? Does not
the matter to which it refers immediately become
the subject of general conversation? and, if the
names compromised should include those of men
whose services to the State have long rendered
them objects of public esteem, or even of national
pride, what a sensation is excited! what conjectures
are afloat! what a fine field is opened for
calumny, for the outpourings of envy, hatred, and
every vile passion! And, in the face of all this,
are we to acquit clandestinely and without publicity,
our colleagues, so injuriously compromised;
and, by a silent absolution, to deprive them of the
atonement they are entitled to expect from your
courageous and just impartiality?</p>

<p>A serious affair has been submitted to our deliberation
by the crown. Our duty is to judge it as
a Court of Peers. In this chamber accusations
have been uttered, more or less grave. We cannot
forget that the names of several noble Peers have,
from base motives, been compromised in this affair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
It is our duty to render them full and complete
justice. By what means shall we do so?</p>

<p>In my endeavours to solve this question, I had
almost arrived at the conclusion, that the proper
course would be to arraign the accused before the
court, to hear the sentence pronounced on them.
But further consideration soon convinced me that
we had entered on a mistaken and perilous course,
and that our first duty is to end the scandalous controversy,
in which virtue and honour have been exposed
to the vilest attacks. What, in reality, is the
question at issue? Great errors have been committed.
French treasure has been improvidently
wasted. But improvidence cannot be made amenable
to the law. On looking over the list of the accused,
I perceive only the names of men more or less obscure,
suspected of acts more or less mean and
contemptible—acts for the commission of which
war ever has and ever will afford ample opportunity.</p>

<p>Three hundred millions have been expended in
the Spanish war. Of that enormous sum scarcely
the sixth part has been absorbed by the victorious
army; and yet, inconceivable as it may appear,
that army has been made to bear the whole responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
However painful the recollection, it is nevertheless
necessary to bear in mind the dismay which
prevailed throughout Paris when, shortly after the
departure of the Prince Generalissimo, the <cite>Moniteur</cite>
officially announced the existence of a military
conspiracy. The nucleus of that conspiracy was
alleged to be in the Staff of His Royal Highness.
But the descendant of Henry IV. was not intimidated;
he showed that he could trust to the
honour of French officers, and victory was the
reward of his confidence. Thus were the intrigues
of the past defeated; and in like manner will be
thwarted the intrigues of the present. All has
been intrigue throughout this affair. It has already
occupied too much of our attention; and it were
to be wished that we should never hear more of it
either in the Chamber of Peers or in any other
court. I can vote only for the full and complete
acquittal of all the accused, and I recommend that
the verdict be accompanied by the declaration that
our colleagues have forfeited none of our esteem.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="fragment">ANOTHER FRAGMENT FROM PRINCE TALLEYRAND’S MEMOIRS.</h3>

<p>The king insisted that the favourable opinion entertained
of the services I had rendered him, required
that he should instal me in one of the high offices of
the crown. The post of grand ecuyer could not
be said to be either vacant or filled, as M. de L——
had not tendered his resignation. The king, who
still had a leaning to old usages, thought he could
not dispose of the post, though the conduct of
M. de L——, since the Restoration, had not
been congenial with French feeling, but altogether
in unison with Austrian ideas. The office
of grand chamberlain seemed to be suited to me,
though I had filled it under Bonaparte, who deprived
me of it to mark his dissatisfaction at the
attentions I showed the Spanish princes at Valençay,
and at the manner in which I had expressed
myself concerning the war against Spain. I lost
my post of grand chamberlain, with a salary of
100,000 francs, because I had rendered some assistance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
and offered some little solace, to the
princes of Spain, during their sojourn at Valençay;
and subsequently, the Restoration took from me
the post of vice-chamberlain, with a salary of
333,000 francs. Yet I never expressed the least
disquietude respecting my fortune, or any desire to
seek the means of enlarging my income.</p>

<p>The king restored me to the post of grand chamberlain,
with the emolument of 100,000 francs.
This post, owing to the pretensions of the gentlemen
of the bedchamber, had become a mere
sinecure. It conferred rank, dignity, and emolument,
without requiring the performance of any
duties. The gentlemen of the bedchamber had
returned to their places, with all their old pretensions;
vanity prompted them to encroach on
the highest and most honourable services, whilst
courtly meanness made them ready to perform the
most annoying and undignified duties. In the
circumstances in which I was placed, I felt that
my proper course of conduct was to avoid all expression
of disapprobation towards the ministers
who had succeeded me, and to take no part in the
numerous reproaches vented on their administration.
My old-fashioned notions of decorum suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
to me the delicacy due from the ministers
who had gone out of office, to the ministers who
had come in; and I determined to confine myself
completely within the sphere of my post of grand
chamberlain. Accordingly, I presented myself to
the king once a week: the rest of my time I
spent among my old books, and in narrating the
events I have witnessed in my life-time, or in
which I have taken part. I never spoke in the
Chamber of Peers, because I wished to avoid alike
the expression of censure or approval. I rarely
voted; and, in short, I endeavoured, as much as
possible, to maintain the character of indifference;—a
most essential qualification in a grand chamberlain.
I imagined that, in observing this line of
conduct towards my successors, I should secure,
on their part, respect, or, at all events, their
silence in reference to the administration of my
colleagues and myself. I was, consequently, not a
little astonished, when I found, in the journals
under the control of their censorship, that all the
mean adulation lavished on the existing ministers,
was accompanied by comparisons prejudicial to the
ministers who had preceded them. Certain comments
on the treaty I had refused to sign, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
which they had affixed their signature, appeared to
me at once exceedingly unfair and maladroit; for
future generations will not fail to compare the truly
French feeling of the men who quitted office because
they would not sign, and the pliant principles
of the men who signed, in order to keep
office. The fact is, that the interests of France
were completely disregarded in this matter. The
Allies took advantage of the inexperience of the
Duke de Richelieu’s administration; and that circumstance
cost France the loss of some portion of
her territory, at the same time entailing so many
other sacrifices, that I have sometimes reproached
myself for my resignation at that particular juncture.
Certainly, had I been in office, France would
not have been subject to the humiliations she
has suffered, and which no power should have presumed
to inflict on her. It is for me alone to
reproach myself. In the estimation of others, I
stand in that position in which it was more noble
to have resigned office, because I would not sign,
than to have signed for the sake of keeping my
place. After all, there is some grace in knowing
when to resign. The position in which I stood
ought not to have exposed me to the insults of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
journalists. Silence would have been more becoming;
but it is difficult for people of mean
spirit to restrain themselves by silence. At first I
considered these attacks unworthy of notice, and
it was only by their daily renewal that I was
enabled to perceive they were the result of a
settled plan. It was only when they were perseveringly
forced on my attention, that I found
it necessary to adopt means to repress them. Public
credulity readily imbibes erroneous impressions.
I tried the effect of absence. I went into the
country, and remained there for some time; but all
in vain! Unpopularity rendered my successors
dissatisfied with themselves. It is the nature of
man to blame others, and not himself, for his own
errors; accordingly, I was still the individual
against whom censure was directed. But for my
influence, it was alleged, certain things would
have been done, and certain measures would have
succeeded—a more decided course would have
been taken, &amp;c. &amp;c. Little-minded people always
assign their failures to causes in which they themselves
have no part. I now thought it time to
show less forbearance, and I openly avowed, to my
friends and others, whom I casually saw, that I did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
not approve the line of policy adopted by the
ministers, nor indeed of any of the means resorted
to for establishing the government of the Restoration.
The ministerial interference with the elections,
(an example which has been followed in
latter times, with such disastrous results,) afforded
me an opportunity of declaring my sentiments.</p>

<p>The first person to whom I spoke on this subject
was Baron Pasquier, with whom I dined one
day at the English Ambassador’s. We were each
waiting for his carriage, and consequently our
conversation was but short. Nevertheless, it would
appear that enough passed to afford grounds for
misrepresentation, and the king was pleased to
think that the best mode of supporting his ministry,
was to show his disapproval of me. In a
letter, written by the first gentleman of the bedchamber,
his majesty forbade my appearing at
court, without the royal permission. Thus, in the
same <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fauteuil</i> in which I had twice installed him,
did Louis XVIII. sign, without any previous explanation,
and on the report of a man whom he
scarcely knew, an order prohibiting me from going
to the Tuileries.</p>

<p>Whilst I was suffering under this species of disgrace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
I had many visitors. The marshals, and
other persons to whom I had never rendered any
service, came to see me more frequently than those
on whom I had conferred obligations. These
latter were prudent; they feared lest they might
themselves incur courtly disfavour. I have remarked
the proneness to this kind of ingratitude at
the present day. The false position in which every
one has been placed since the Restoration has
doubtless helped to create it. That sort of police
which society itself exercises, for repressing the
wrongs of society, having ceased to exist, the evil
passions of human nature show themselves more
openly. The emigration has largely contributed to
bring about this state of things.</p>

<p>My disgrace did not tend to raise the king in
public estimation, either abroad or at home; and
his majesty was therefore desirous of bringing the
matter to an end. The same Gentleman of the
Chamber who wrote the letter forbidding my appearance
at court, now wrote to acquaint me that
the king would receive me again with pleasure. I
went, and, to spare the king embarrassment, I
did not attempt to enter into any explanation.
I was aware that he would not acknowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
he had been in the wrong, and yet that acknowledgment
was the only great and gracious thing he
could have uttered.</p>

<p>I felt that what passed between the king and
myself entitled me to censure or disapprove measures
which appeared to me injurious to France; and
I began occasionally to deliver my opinion in the
Chamber of Peers on the questions discussed in
that assembly. I endeavoured to show that the
government would gain strength by taking an
honest and constitutional course, and disavowing
all falsehood and evasion; that sincerity in the
management of public affairs would simplify everything,
and consolidate at once the position of the
king and of the country. The French people are
too shrewd to be imposed on for any length of
time, and when once they find themselves deceived
they are ever afterwards distrustful. In the interval
between the sessions I made two excursions into
the provinces. The aspect of nature has a wonderful
effect on the mind, especially when one has
just escaped from the strife and agitation of public
affairs. Matters which fret and weary us in the active
business of life, dwindle into insignificance in the
retirement of the country. On the summit of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
mountain we feel alike beyond the reach of towering
ambition and grovelling malice. There all the
annoying phantoms of life vanish.</p>

<p>At the beginning of winter I returned to Paris.
My associations were limited to persons whose
opinions coincided with my own, and I took part
in no public business except the discussions on
the liberty of the press, which were maintained
during two or three years successively. I observed
the course of events in all parts of Europe, and
watched the contest that was maintained between
despotism and constitutional government. The
first decided outbreaks of this contest were manifested
at Naples and at Venice. Speedily the
revolution in Spain spread agitation throughout
France, and brought to light the work in which the
Jesuits had been secretly engaged since the Restoration.
The ministry, which was composed of
emigrants, or of persons whose minds were tainted
with the prejudice and bigotry which the emigration
had brought back to France, conferred all government
appointments on persons of their own way of
thinking, or on those who, from interested motives,
affected to coincide in their views. Then followed
congress upon congress, intrigue upon intrigue;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
and the Emperor Alexander showed his feebleness
of character by seeking refuge in that Holy Alliance
which too plainly demonstrated that sovereigns
had interests apart from those of their subjects.
I often think of what must be the result of
the existing conflict between intelligence and despotism.
I reflect on the great change that will be
wrought by new compacts between subjects and
sovereigns. It is only by this means that social
order can be established. We are told that this
or that particular country requires more stringent
measures of government than others; but all nations
have rights, which vary according to the
greater or less degree of civilization they may have
reached. The recognition of these rights is at
once the security of thrones and the guarantee of
public freedom. These rights may and can be
enforced without popular convulsions; but, in
proportion as the rights of mankind are disavowed
or withheld, the more violent will be the struggles
to recover them, and in the end these struggles will
prove triumphant. This is my opinion, and it will
remain unaltered to the latest day of my life.</p>

<h3 id="william">LETTER TO HIS MAJESTY KING WILLIAM IV., FROM
PRINCE TALLEYRAND, ON HIS BEING APPOINTED
AMBASSADOR FROM FRANCE.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sire</span>,—His Majesty the King of the French has
been pleased to make me the interpreter of the
sentiments he cherishes for your Majesty.</p>

<p>“I have joyfully accepted a mission which gives
so noble a direction to the last steps of my long
public career.</p>

<p>“Sire, amidst all the vicissitudes through which I
have passed during my long life—amidst all the
changes of good and ill fortune I have undergone
during the last forty years, no circumstance has
afforded me such perfect gratification as the appointment
which brings me back to this happy
country. But how great is the change between the
period when I was formerly here and the present
time! The jealousies and prejudices which so
long divided France and England have given
place to enlightened sentiments of esteem and
affection. Unity of feeling rivets the bonds of
amity between the two countries. England, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
France, repudiates the principle of intervention in
the internal affairs of neighbouring states; and
the ambassador of a sovereign unanimously chosen
by a great nation, feels himself at home in a land
of freedom, as the missionary to a descendant of
the illustrious house of Brunswick.</p>

<p>“I feel that I may with confidence implore your
Majesty’s kind consideration of the subjects which
I am commanded to submit to your attention, and
I beg, Sire, to offer the homage of my profound
respect.”</p>

<h3 id="journals">OPINION OF PRINCE TALLEYRAND ON THE PLAN OF
LAW RELATIVE TO JOURNALS AND PERIODICAL
PUBLICATIONS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered in the Chamber of Peers, in the sitting of Tuesday,
July 24, 1821.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,—In presenting myself before this
assembly, I experience the embarrassment of feeling
the utter inutility of the observations I am about to
make, but to which, nevertheless, I consider it my
duty to give utterance. By a deplorable fatality,
the causes of which it is not my purpose at present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
to inquire into, the questions in appearance submitted
to our consideration, are already resolved—irrevocably
resolved. We discuss, as though our
discussions were affairs of some import; whilst, in
reality, we are but the instruments of imperious
necessity. Laws and budgets are laid before us,
and they who would naturally be our opponents in
discussing them, are not here; their absence operates
as a sort of command upon us. The Chamber
of Peers, by the position in which it is placed,
will soon degenerate into a Court of Registration, a
mere semblance of the constitutional hierarchy.
Hence, it follows, that those who absolutely desire
to see in France a real Chamber of Peers—that
those who regard it as essential to the monarchy—seeing
it annihilated for the present, look forward
to the future. In their inability to remedy the present
evil, they indulge in prophetic warnings, which
it is easy to turn into ridicule; or they offer advice
which levity despises and weakness rejects.</p>

<p>“I apply, gentlemen, these considerations to the
law now submitted to your attention. Is it the
work of the Ministry? No; for, on the one hand,
it is more limited in its duration than the primitive
law, a circumstance of which I am certainly not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
disposed to complain; and, on the other hand, its
restrictions extend to literature, science, and the
arts, (heretofore exempt from the coercion of the
censorship:) and at these restrictions I am assuredly
not disposed to rejoice. Is it certain that these
various modifications meet the concurrence of the
majority of this Chamber? Possibly they do not;
and yet, what can we do? Are we free to amend,
in our turn, the amendments of the all-powerful
Chamber of Deputies? No, gentlemen; and I say
so, not with the view of reflecting blame on the
Chamber of Deputies, (which has merely exercised
its constitutional privileges in a very constitutional
manner,) but to complain that the Chamber of
Peers is stripped of all its privileges by tardy presentations,
which leave it neither time to deliberate
nor power to resist.</p>

<p>“Convinced as I am that the fate of the present
law is determined beforehand; that a discussion,
however warm, will not influence its rejection, or
even tend to modify its effects; I present myself
here, less for the purpose of opposing it, than to
prevent its reappearance, when it shall have lived
through its legal period of existence. I speak for
the interest of the future session, and not for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
interest of the present one. I do not hope, gentlemen,
to convince you now; my object is to pave
the way for a more free and more profound discussion
at a future time.</p>

<p>“The liberty of the press, applied to politics, is,
as has already been stated, neither more nor less
than the liberty of the journals.</p>

<p>“We are all desirous to enjoy the blessings of
representative government; it is the government
which the king has granted to us.</p>

<p>“Representative government cannot exist without
the liberty of the press, which is one of its essential
instruments; indeed, its principal instrument.
Every government has its own machinery; and it
must always be borne in mind that institutions
which are salutary to one government, may be injurious
to another. It has been proved to demonstration
by several members of this Chamber, who,
during the present and preceding sessions, have
spoken on the subject now under consideration,
that, without the liberty of the press, there can be
no representative government. I will not, therefore,
weary you by repeating that which you must
all have heard or read, and which must frequently
have been the subject of your own meditations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
“But there are two points of view in which it
appears to me that the question has not been adequately
considered, and which I will reduce to the
two following <span class="locked">propositions—</span></p>

<p>“I. The liberty of the press is a necessity of the
age.</p>

<p>“II. A government endangers its stability when
it obstinately refuses to grant that which the age
proclaims to be necessary.</p>

<p>“The human mind is never completely stationary.
The discovery of yesterday is but the medium for
arriving at a new discovery to-morrow. Nevertheless
it is true that human intelligence would
seem to advance by crises; there are periods when
that intelligence is urged forward by the desire of
creating and producing; and there are times when,
satisfied with its acquisitions, it appears to repose
within itself, and to be occupied in arranging and
setting in order the riches it possesses, rather than
in earning new wealth. The seventeenth century
was one of these fortunate epochs. The human
mind, amazed at the vast treasures of which it had
become possessed through the invention of printing,
seemed to stop short in its onward movement,
as if eager to rest in the enjoyment of its magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
heritage. Revelling in the luxuries of literature,
science, and the arts, it set its glory on the
production of master-pieces. The great men of
the age of Louis XIV. vied one with another in
embellishing a state of society, beyond which they
could see nothing or wish for nothing, and which
seemed destined to endure as long as the glory of
the great king who engrossed all their respect and
enthusiasm. But the fertile mine of antiquity
being exhausted, the activity of the human mind
was turned, as it were by force, into another channel,
and it found novelty in those speculative
studies which embrace the whole future, and whose
limits are indefinable. Such were the circumstances
which ushered in the commencement of
the eighteenth century, destined to prove so dissimilar
to the century that had preceded it. The
poetic lessons of Telemachus were succeeded by
the theories of the Esprit des Lois; and the Port-Royal
was superseded by the Encyclopedia.</p>

<p>“I beg you to observe, gentlemen, that I am
neither concurring nor approving, but merely
narrating.</p>

<p>“On looking back to the disasters which befel
France during the Revolution, we should guard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
against being wholly unjust to those master spirits
whose writings gave the first impulse to that great
event. We must not forget that if those writers
did not always steer clear of error, yet that we owe
to them the revelation of many great truths. We
must bear in mind that those men are in no way
responsible for the inconsiderate precipitancy with
which France, almost unanimously, rushed into the
career which they had merely traced out in perspective.
Views which had been only theoretically developed
were suddenly carried into practical effect; and
the result has shown the awful consequences which
ensue when man, prompted by insane self-confidence,
ventures to go beyond the necessities of the
age—the gulf of misfortune then yawns before him.
But in merely working such changes as are dictated
by the wants of the age, we are certain not to
diverge very far from the right course.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, let us see what were the real
necessities of the age in the year 1789. The
changes which were suggested by the mature reflection
of enlightened men may be fairly regarded
as necessities. The Constituent Assembly was
merely the interpreter of those necessities when it
proclaimed the liberty of religious worship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
equality in the eye of the law, the free right of
jurisdiction, (every one being amenable to his
natural judges,) and the liberty of the press.</p>

<p>“But the Constituent Assembly was not in accordance
with the spirit of the age when it instituted
a single Chamber; when it destroyed the
royal sanction; when it tortured consciences, &amp;c.
Yet, notwithstanding the errors of that Assembly,
(errors of which I have named only a few, and
which were followed by great calamities,) it will
enjoy, in the judgment of posterity, the glory of
having established the bases of our new public law.
The august author of the charter—the monarch
who is worthy of France, as France is worthy of
him—has consecrated in his noble work the only
great principles furnished by the Constituent
Assembly.</p>

<p>“Let us take it for granted that laws which are
wished for—which are proclaimed to be good and
salutary by the most enlightened men of a country,
and which have been so proclaimed during a series
of years—are necessities of the age. One of these
laws, gentlemen, is the liberty of the press. I appeal
to all those among you who are most especially
my contemporaries—was not the liberty of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
press an object ardently desired by all those
excellent men whom we have admired in our
youth—the Malesherbes, the d’Estignys, and the
Trudaines?—who, to say the least, were not inferior
to any of the statesmen who have flourished since
their time. The place which the men I have just
named occupy in our recollections, sufficiently
proves that the liberty of the press consolidates
legitimate renown, and if it ruins usurped reputations,
where is the evil?</p>

<p>“If I have said enough to prove that the liberty
of the press is, in France, the necessary result of the
present state of society, it now only remains for me
to establish my second proposition—viz., that a
government endangers its stability when it obstinately
refuses to grant that which the age proclaims
to be a necessity.</p>

<p>“In the most tranquil and happy conditions of
society there is always a certain number of men
who aspire to gain, by the help of disorder, the
wealth which they possess not, and the importance
which they ought not to possess. Is it wise to
place in the hands of these enemies of social order,
weapons of discontent, without which their perversity
would ever remain powerless? Why give them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
the privilege of continually claiming the fulfilment
of a promise? They will but abuse that privilege,
and in this instance they are not, as in some others,
seeking merely a chimerical good.</p>

<p>“Society, in its progressive advance, is destined
to feel new necessities. I readily admit that governments
ought not rashly to acknowledge them or
to convert them into laws. But when these necessities
have once been acknowledged, to take back
what has been granted, or (which amounts to the
same thing) to withhold that which has been
granted, or to suspend it unceasingly, is a dangerous
course, of which I earnestly hope those who
have put it in practice may not have reason to repent.
A government should never compromise its
own good faith. In the present age, it is not easy
to carry on deception for any lengthened period of
time. There is a power whose wisdom is superior
to that of Voltaire, whose intelligence is greater
than that of Bonaparte—a power, in short, superior
to the directors or to any of the ministers, past,
present, or to come—that power is the great mass
of mankind. To engage, or at least to persist, in a
conflict on any question on which the majority of
the world conceive their interests to be at stake, is
an error, and all political errors are dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
“When the freedom of the press exists, when
people know that their interests will be defended,
they trust that time will render them justice, however
tardily that justice may come. They rely on
hope, and with reason, for even hope cannot be
long deceived. But when the liberty of the press
is restricted, when no complaint is permitted to be
heard, discontent forces a government either into
too much weakness or too much severity.</p>

<p>“But these reflections are carrying me too far,
and I must conclude. For the interest of the King
and of France, I demand a repressive law, and I
vote against the censorship.”</p>

<h3 id="autun1">OPINION OF THE BISHOP OF AUTUN ON THE SUBJECT
OF ECCLESIASTICAL PROPERTY, DELIVERED
IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN THE YEAR
1789.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> following extracts comprise the principal
points of this address.]</p>

<p>“I have stated, gentlemen, the reasons which
lead me to believe that ecclesiastical property
is national property. If those reasons, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
nothing has for an instant shaken in my own
mind, appear to you of some weight in themselves,
how much more weighty, how much more decisive
must they not appear under all the circumstances of
the present juncture? Let us only look around
us; the public fortune is tottering—its approaching
fall threatens all other fortunes, and in this
universal disaster who would have greater cause to
fear than the clergy? Invidious comparisons have
long been made between the public indigence and
the private opulence of many among us; let us
silence in one moment these unpleasant murmurs,
so offensive to our patriotism. Let us deliver up to
the nation both our persons and our fortunes;—the
nation will never forget the act.</p>

<p>“Let us not say that the clergy, merely from
being no longer landed proprietors, will on that
account become less worthy of public consideration.
No! the clergy will not be the less revered by the
people from their being paid by the nation; for
the heads of offices, ministers, and even kings
themselves, receive salaries without being the less
honoured on that account. No! the clergy will not
become odious to the people, for it is not from the
individual hands of the citizens that the minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
of religion will seek his tribute, but from the public
treasury, like all the other mandatories of the government.
Do we not constantly see the people
consenting to forget that the functionaries of the
state are in their pay, and uniting with their generous
tributes the personal homage of respect for men
whose duties are often opposed to their passions,
and sometimes even to their interests? Who shall
persuade us to believe that the French people, whose
sense of justice is greater than their calumniators
would lead us to suppose, would withdraw their
grateful esteem from those who ought not, who will
not, who cannot inspire them with any but virtuous
sentiments; who would pour into their bosoms the
consolations of charity, and discharge towards them
at all times the most paternal duties?</p>

<p>“Say not that the cause of religion is bound up
with this question;—say rather, what we all know,
say that the greatest act of religion which would
redound to our own honour, would be to hasten the
arrival of that period when a better order of things
will sweep away the abuses of corruption, and will
prevent the occurrence of that multitude of open
crimes and secret offences which are the fruits of
great public calamities. Say that the noblest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
homage that can be paid to religion, is to contribute
to the formation of a state of social order
which should foster and protect the virtues religion
ordains and rewards, and which, in the
perfection of society, should constantly remind
men of the benefactor of nature. The people,
brought back to religion by the feeling of their
own happiness, will remember, not without gratitude,
the sacrifices which the ministers of religion
will have made for the general good. Everything
unites in demanding it. Public opinion everywhere
proclaims the law of justice, united to that
of necessity. A few moments longer, and we shall
lose, in an unequal and degrading struggle, the
honour of a generous resignation. Let us meet
necessity, and we shall seem not to fear it, or
rather, to use a form of expression more worthy of
you, we shall in reality not fear it. We should not
then be dragged to the altar of the country; we
should be bearing to it a voluntary offering. Of
what use is it to defer the moment? What troubles,
what misfortunes might not have been prevented, if
the sacrifices consummated here for three months
past had been made in proper time a gift of patriotism?
Let us show that we wish to be citizens, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
citizens only, and that we really desire to join in
the national unity which France so ardently longs
for. Finally, in ceasing to form a body which is a
constant object of envy, the clergy will become an
assemblage of citizens, and objects of national
gratitude.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, then, I would recommend that
the principle involving the proprietorship of the
ecclesiastical revenues should be at once determined;
and, to avoid all appearance of equivocation,
I would recommend it should be decreed by
the National Assembly that the nation is the real
proprietor, and can dispose of them for the public
good. The nation must at the same time pledge
itself to preserve for each incumbent that which
really belongs to him, and to provide for the due
settlement (in such manner as may be deemed most
fitting) of the real obligations with which those
properties are burthened.”</p>

<h3 id="autun2">EXTRACTS FROM THE SPEECH OF THE BISHOP OF
AUTUN, ON THE OCCASION OF HIS MOTION ON
THE SUBJECT OF ECCLESIASTICAL REFORM, ON
THE 10TH OF OCTOBER, 1789.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> state has for a long time had to struggle
with the greatest difficulties: none of us are ignorant
of this fact, and therefore powerful means
must be employed to meet them. Ordinary
measures have been exhausted; the people are
hard-pressed on every side, and the slightest additional
burden would naturally be felt insupportable.
In fact, it is not to be thought of. Extraordinary
resources have just been tried, but they
are principally destined for the extraordinary
necessities of the present year. We want provision
for the future—we want provision for the
entire restoration of order. There exists one immense
and decided resource, and one which in my
opinion (for otherwise I should repel the idea) may
be combined with a rigid respect for property.
This resource appears to me to lie entirely in the
ecclesiastical revenues.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
“I do not mean a contribution towards maintaining
the burthens of the state proportional to
that arising from other kinds of property; this could
never be viewed in the light of a sacrifice. The
operation I point at is one of far greater importance
to the nation.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“It appears evident to me that the clergy are
not in the position of other landed proprietors,
because the property they enjoy (and which they
cannot dispose of) has been given, not for personal
interest, but for the performance of certain duties.</p>

<p>“It would also appear that the nation, in
virtue of the extensive powers it possesses over
all the bodies contained within it, has a right
to destroy, if not the whole, at all events, portions
of the ecclesiastical body, if they are considered
hurtful, or even useless, and that this right over
their existence necessarily carries with it an extensive
right over the disposal of its property.</p>

<p>“It is moreover certain that the nation, precisely
because it is the protector of the wishes of the
founders, can, and even ought to suppress those
livings which have become sinecures.</p>

<p>“Thus far there is no difficulty; but the question
is, Can the nation also reduce the revenue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
of the actual incumbents, and dispose of a portion
of that revenue? There appears to me one very
simple answer to the arguments of those who deny
this right.</p>

<p>“However inviolable may be the possession of a
property which is guaranteed by law, it is clear
that the law cannot change the nature of the property
by guaranteeing it; and that, in the case of
ecclesiastical property, it can only ensure to each
actual incumbent the enjoyment of what has really
been granted to him by the act of his foundation.
Now, it is well known that all the foundation-titles
of ecclesiastical property, as well as the various
laws of the church explanatory of the sense and
the spirit of those titles, show that only that portion
of the property which is necessary for the
decent maintenance of the incumbent really belongs
to him—that he is merely the administrator
of the remainder, which remainder is really destined
for the relief of the poor, or the repair of
the temples of God. If, then, the nation carefully
ensures to each incumbent (whatever may be the
nature of his living) that respectable maintenance,
it will not be encroaching upon his individual property.
If, at the same time, it takes upon itself, as
it has the undoubted right to do, the administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
of the rest; if it undertakes the other obligations
attached to these properties, such as the
maintenance of hospitals and charitable institutions,
the repairs of churches, the expenses of
public education, &amp;c.; if, above all, these resources
are drawn upon only at the moment of a
general calamity, it appears to me that all the intentions
of the founders will be fulfilled, and full
justice will have been rigidly accomplished.</p>

<p>“Thus, in brief recapitulation, I would state my
belief, that the nation may, without injustice, in a
period of general distress, 1st, dispose of the properties
of the different religious communities which
it may be desirable to suppress, ensuring, at the
same time, means of subsistence to the incumbents;
2ndly, turn to immediate account (always
carrying out the general spirit of the founders) the
revenues of all the sinecure livings which may be
vacant, and secure those of all similar livings as
they become vacant; and 3rdly, reduce, according
to a certain proportion, the present revenues of the
incumbents, whenever they shall exceed a certain
given sum, the nation taking upon itself a portion
of the obligations with which those properties were
originally charged.”</p>

<h3 id="autun3">EXTRACTS FROM THE ADDRESS OF THE BISHOP OF
AUTUN ON THE SUBJECT OF BANKS, AND ON
THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF ORDER IN THE
FRENCH FINANCES.</h3>

<p class="center b1"><i>Delivered in the National Assembly, on Friday, Dec. 4th, 1789.</i></p>

<p>“As a member of the committee whose report
you have just heard, I consider myself
entitled to address you, both for the purpose of
submitting to you some ideas of my own on the
subject of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">caisse d’escompte</i>, and more especially
with the view of bringing to bear upon this
subject some important questions, inseparable from
it, and essentially connected with the great interests
which now so urgently engage your attention.</p>

<p>“The idea of the establishment of a national
bank in France, is one which has excited great
attention, and which has gained great favour in
public opinion.</p>

<p>“Many persons who entertain sound views on
the subject of credit, consider such an establishment
as indispensable, whilst even those who are
least acquainted with the subject—those who
scarcely know what a bank is, and who are totally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
ignorant of the organization suitable to a national
bank, seem to derive confidence, amidst the present
want of credit, simply from understanding that
the National Assembly contemplates the establishment
of a national bank. It would indeed seem
as if the mere name of a bank were alone sufficient
to settle everything; but we must be careful to observe
that it is only a well-constituted bank that
ought to be established, and not a national bank of
any sort. Banks are by no means simple institutions;
their object is indeed everywhere the same—to
facilitate the circulation of exchanges, and
to lower the interest of money; but the means they
employ must vary extremely. Banks may be
likened to highly-tempered instruments, which must
be managed with caution and skill, because either
great good or great evil may result from their use.
Here, above all, you must be upon your guard
against the various systems suggested by cupidity,
by superficial knowledge, or by that half-acquaintance
with the subject which is so common and so
dangerous. It cannot, therefore, be entirely useless
to recall to your attention, for the purpose of refuting
them, the different ideas which have been
promulgated on the creation of a national bank in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
France, particularly as some of these views have
neither been opposed nor discussed, and are, perhaps,
of a nature to mislead the well-intentioned.
Let us take a cursory view of them.</p>

<p>“The creation of a national bank has been proposed.
My opinion is, that a well-constituted
bank ought not to be a national bank, whether by
that title we understand simply the responsibility
of the nation, or that the nation should have established
the bank on its own account.</p>

<p>“People are led to believe that, because the nation
is about to render itself responsible for the public
debt, it might also be answerable for the funds of a
bank; but it is very important that these two things
should not be confounded.</p>

<p>“The nation ought undoubtedly to become responsible
for the public debt, inasmuch as the sums
which compose that debt have been lent to the
nation, have been employed by the nation, and
have been entrusted to the only recognised representative
of the nation. In fact, properly speaking,
the nation cannot be said to be security for the
debt, for the nation is the debtor itself.</p>

<p>“The guarantee which the nation would grant to
the bank should be of a totally different nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
“So far from this national guarantee imparting
credit to a bank, such an arrangement would have
the effect of depriving of all credit the nation
capable of adopting it. Who would place confidence
in a nation which should be imprudent
enough to entrust to a small number of individuals
the management of a bank whose operations would
necessarily be unlimited, and whereby all the
national property would become mortgaged?</p>

<p>“It may readily be imagined that every possible
precaution would be taken to prevent the managers
of the bank from being unfaithful to their trust; but
still the possibility will always remain, that, should
a misfortune befal the bank, it would be necessary
either to levy enormous contributions on the property
of the country, or to declare the nation itself
bankrupt. Would any prudent nation incur the
risk of reducing itself to such an alternative?
Would any honest nation, valuing a character for
integrity, offer a responsibility which might prove
illusory?</p>

<p>“The nation, then, cannot, ought not, to become
guarantee for the bank.</p>

<p>“Still less ought the nation to establish the bank
on its own account; for, to all the inconveniences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
resulting from responsibility, there would be added
many others. The nation would have only two
methods to choose between, either to entrust the
administration of the bank to salaried officials, or
to personally interested managers. In the first
case, there would be too much reason to fear that
the management of the bank would not receive due
attention; while, in the second case, there would
be an equal risk of the directors seeking immoderate
profits, under the pretence of serving the
interests of the nation with which they would be
associated. In either case, should any misfortune
befal the bank, the representatives of the country
would, with much less freedom, deliver their opinion
on events in which the interest of the whole nation
would be compromised, than if they had merely to
judge the conduct of private directors. And, finally,
in both cases the annual expenses of management
would be increased, and the portion of profits
which the nation might directly claim from the
operations of the bank, would certainly not indemnify
it for the incalculable loss resulting
from the diminished interest of money in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>“The nation, therefore, cannot become guarantee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
for the bank, nor can the bank be established on
account of the nation.”</p>

<p>“It has been proposed to establish banks of discount
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">caisses d’escompte</i>) in different towns of
the kingdom, and this plan certainly looks somewhat
plausible; for it would seem at first sight that
if banks of discount are useful, they cannot be too
much multiplied, and that if they are favourable
to commerce, they ought, above all, to be established
in commercial towns.</p>

<p>“But it is easy to perceive that a single bank of
discount, or bank of aid (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">banque de secours</i>),
placed in the capital, in the centre of circulation,
would not only animate the commerce of the
place in which it is established, but would necessarily
extend its influence throughout the whole of
the kingdom.</p>

<p>“Now, a number of banks of discount, or banks
of aid, would not produce the same advantages;
for by mutually increasing their credit, they would
infallibly injure each other.</p>

<p>“In the first place, the multiplicity of these banks
would oblige every individual to examine all the
different bank-notes presented to him, whilst at
present a great portion of the confidence with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
these notes are received, proceeds from the circumstance
of their requiring no examination, being
recognisable at first sight, almost as readily as
pieces of coin.</p>

<p>“This observation is, perhaps, more important
than it may appear. There can be no doubt that
a degree of credit would be attached to the notes
of a single bank applicable to the whole kingdom,
which would never be accorded to the notes of a
number of banks, dispersed among the provinces;
for, as each of these several banks would enjoy a
different degree of credit, the notes of each would
require previous examination, before being taken
in payment.</p>

<p>“But, independently of this consideration, another
very grave inconvenience would arise. The embarrassments
of any one of these banks would inevitably
operate prejudicially on the credit of the
rest, from the correspondence which would exist
among them. To multiply the places where these
embarrassments might ensue, would be to multiply
their probability, and it is, doubtless, important
not to augment the chances which may compromise
the trade and the monetary circulation of the
kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
“A plan has been proposed for supplying the
place of this multiplicity of banks, by admitting
the existence of one general bank alone, having
in most of the provincial towns branch establishments,
where the notes of the bank would be paid on
presentation. This idea is the most impracticable
of all. With the inconveniences of the preceding
plan, it combines a still greater inconvenience of
its own; for it is evident that the bank, instead of
merely holding in its principal treasury such portion
of its capital as prudence might show to be
necessary, would at the same time require to hold
a similar portion in each of its branch establishments.
But for this precaution, it would be in
the power of evil-disposed persons to convey a
considerable number of notes into any particular
town in which there was a branch bank; even
chance, or some circumstance impossible to foresee,
might draw a great quantity of notes at one
time into some particular branch bank, which
might not be in a condition to honour them. If
there were but fifty of these branch offices dispersed
in different towns of the kingdom, the probability
is, that there would be a failure of the
bank in different places almost every day of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
year, though the sums it held in cash, distributed
among its different treasuries, might, in the aggregate,
be very much beyond the whole demands
made upon it.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“As to the banking plan which has been proposed
to you by the Minister of Finance, and which, on
that account, merits your deepest attention, I shall
add little to the observations which have already
been made in opposition to it. I shall confine
myself to a single remark, which, however, I must
confess, appears to me decisive. This plan is
founded on the creation of a paper circulation <em>not
convertible into money at will</em>, consequently, on
the creation of a paper-money. Now, there do not
exist, at least in my opinion, two ideas more opposed
to each other than the existence of paper-money
and of a bank: the one bears the character
of constraint and authority, whilst the other, on the
contrary, can be maintained only by the most free
and unlimited confidence.</p>

<p>“Although I have thus shown, or at least mentioned,
the inconveniences of most of the banking
systems which have been proposed, it is not my
intention to submit to you any plan of my own. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
will, however, add a few observations bearing on
the questions now under consideration. They may
perhaps throw some light on principles which seem
to me not sufficiently understood.</p>

<p>“The fundamental law of any bank whatever, is
to fulfil its engagements when they fall due: I
know of no other. If the particular position of the
bank is such as to enable it to undertake engagements
at sight, and payable at any moment, then
this bank should be so regulated as to be at all
times fully prepared to pay its engagements on presentation.
Such is the rule which common sense
would dictate.</p>

<p>“It is a common idea that the direct object of a
bank is to throw notes into circulation. Undoubtedly
the power of issuing notes is an immediate
consequence of the credit of a bank; but we must
beware of confounding this result with the real
object of the institution of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">banque de secours</i>.
When we seek a principle, we must of necessity
disengage it from its consequences, however clear
and direct they may be.</p>

<p>“The object of a bank composed of partners <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en
commandite</i>, like the caisse d’escompte, is to furnish
assistance to commerce by bringing together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
funds to be applied to discounting good bills
at a moderate rate of interest. When bills are
presented for discount at this bank, the directors,
provided they agree to give the accommodation,
grant a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon</i>, or order, to receive the cash at their
treasury. The bearer of this order proceeds to the
treasury, procures the cash, and carries it away.
This is the natural course of proceeding, which
was pursued at the commencement; but after going
through the process of discounting paper repeatedly,
and finding that the order on the treasury
was always paid on presentation, it was soon perceived
that it would be paid with equal punctuality
on the following day, and that it was sometimes
more convenient to carry home the order, and send
for the cash when required. This order was next
given in payment to some third party, who, being
also aware of the exactness with which it would be
paid, was in no hurry to present it; and thus, the
knowledge of the punctual payment of the orders
furnished by the directors of the bank upon their
treasury produced in the end the effect, that everybody
felt it to be a matter of indifference whether
he held the note, or the cash which it represented.</p>

<p>“The consequence of this has been that those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
holding an interest in the establishment, finding
that many parties abstained from sending for payment
of the notes made payable at sight at the
treasury, thought they were justified, when good
bills were brought to them with dates not too
distant, in discounting them with a part of the
cash destined to meet their own notes. It is clear,
however, that they could not properly employ for
this purpose any portion of the cash beyond that
which, in the nature of things, would not be demanded
of them before the period fixed for the
return of the money which had been advanced
upon the bills they had discounted.</p>

<p>“So long as bank directors conform, in this respect,
to the rules of prudence, their notes obtain
such a degree of confidence, on account of the
readiness with which they are handled and circulated,
that cash is often brought for the purpose
of buying notes on their treasury. If, on the
contrary, abusing this confidence, and desirous of
extending their transactions and their profits, they
allow themselves at any time to alienate a portion
of their funds, to such an amount as might subject
them to the risk of being applied to for more cash
than they possess, in that case there is at once an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
end of confidence. Thenceforward, their notes are
looked upon only as paper, of which the payment
is uncertain; and, as the business relations of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Banque de Secours</i> connect its directors with all
the bankers of the capital, and with almost all the
branches of circulation in the kingdom, there arises
a feeling of great distrust at home, and still greater
abroad, which rapidly turns the exchange to our
disadvantage, and leads to a restriction of the currency
and all the evils resulting therefrom.</p>

<p>“What, then, should be the conduct of the directors
of such an establishment at periods when confidence
is shaken? Their course is very simple.
They ought to know that at those times they may be
applied to for payment of a portion of their notes,
perhaps of all. They ought, therefore, to use only
an unimportant portion, or even none, of the funds
in their treasury destined to redeem their notes.</p>

<p>“It would be absurd, therefore, for the directors
of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Banque de Secours</i> to pretend there was
nothing wrong in its management so long as they
should maintain in their treasury an amount of
cash equivalent to the <em>third</em> or <em>fourth</em> part of the
amount of their notes in circulation. In this respect,
it is impossible to fix any absolute proportion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
It is necessary that the directors of a bank
should possess a sufficient degree of foresight to
provide themselves, not with a fourth or a third,
but with a half, or three fourths, or even the whole
amount of the funds representing the notes, whenever
any corresponding number of notes are likely
to be presented for payment.</p>

<p>“But, it may be said, the bank would in that case
make no profit. To this I reply, that the chief
object of the protection which the government or
the nation may grant to a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Banque de Secours</i>, is
not to enable those holding an interest in the bank
to make, under all possible circumstances, considerable
and uninterrupted profits. Undoubtedly
the nation should desire to see the bank prosper,
because it is by profit alone that the interested
parties can be induced to maintain an establishment
of the sort, and because the existence of such
an establishment is useful in a state; but the nation
has no interest in desiring more than that the
shareholders should make such profits as are sufficient
to induce them to carry on the bank.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“At periods when confidence is shaken, it is
necessary for a public bank to restrict its operations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
The directors of such an establishment
would be very imprudent, or even culpable, if,
instead of resigning themselves to bear their portion
of the misfortunes of the times, they were to
persist, contrary to the natural course of things, in
giving always an equal extension to their operations,
at the risk of being at length compelled to
come to a stop.</p>

<p>“The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse d’Escompte</i> seems to have fallen
into some of these difficulties, and to have failed to
recognise the fundamental principle of all banks,
which consists in never failing to meet engagements.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse d’Escompte</i> has undoubtedly transgressed
the rules prescribed to it; and yet it is,
perhaps, allowable not to weigh its conduct in an
ordinary balance. It had furnished money which,
doubtless, it had not the right to furnish, because it
did not belong to it; but it has given that assistance
in a crisis which has baffled all human
foresight, and out of deference to a minister in
whom the nation has so justly placed confidence.
It is not necessary that the Assembly should convert
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse d’Escompte</i> into a national bank,
but it is unquestionably necessary that it should
keep account of its advances with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
“M. Necker’s suggestion on this point does not,
I must confess, appear to me to attain the object
desired. I can recognise no real payment in
paper-money, or, if there is a real payment, I see
in it a preference accorded to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse d’Escompte</i>,
which may have the appearance of an injustice to the
other creditors of the state. Why create a paper-money
specially in favour of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse d’Escompte</i>,
and leave other parties to suffer whose claims upon
the nation are at least as sacred?”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“The claims of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse d’Escompte</i> are not less
sacred than those of others, I grant, but neither are
they more so. I will not, therefore, recommend you
to create paper-money for the other creditors, as well
as for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse</i>, but I would conjure you not to
create it at all. The inevitable effect of all paper-money
is, as you know, the rapid disappearance of
cash. The fictitious currency drives away the real;
and as the former can never be a perfectly exact
representation of the latter, it happens that it drives
away far more than it replaces. From that moment
the paper no longer maintains an equality with
cash; it falls below par, and hence the most fatal
consequences. All the creditors who receive payment
in notes lose the difference, while, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
other hand, all the debtors to whom cash had
been advanced, gain the difference, and hence arise
a destruction of property and a general want of
faith in payments—a want of faith the more odious
as it has the sanction of legality. Moreover, as
soon as one set of engagements between individuals
is settled, fresh ones will be formed, or there would
be an end of all business transactions; and here
recommences, in an opposite direction, an operation
no less fatal, no less convulsive, by which the
creditors, in their turn, will ruin the debtors.
Fearing a repayment in notes, and adding by anticipation
the present loss upon those notes to the
still greater loss which they expect may afterwards
be incurred, they swell out their claims to an unreasonable
extent. Thus they entail the ruin of
their debtors when the time arrives at which there
shall be no more notes, or when confidence shall
have brought them to an equality with cash. It is
evident that this is not a reparation of the injustice
first alluded to, but an entirely new species of injustice,
inasmuch as there is neither the same proportion,
nor the same contracting parties, nor the
same engagements.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
“The more we reflect on the true principles of
credit, the more are we convinced that there exists
in this respect no difference between a nation and
a private individual. A nation, like a private
person, possesses credit only so long as it is
known to have the will and the power to pay. A
nation, like an individual, can do nothing better
towards its creditors than to pay in ready money
its engagements when due. If, through some
unfortunate circumstances, the means of payment
in cash are wanting, the best—the only course
which a nation, like an individual, can then adopt,
is to propose to its creditors only such arrangements
as are secure of being carried into effect,
for nothing destroys confidence like exaggerated
promises.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“Rest assured that every mechanical means of
bringing about the re-appearance of specie, such
as the melting down of plate, the purchase of materials
at a great expense, or other such temporary
expedients, though they may afford the appearance
of relief, have really nothing substantial or durable
in their nature. When once the public feeling
leads to the hoarding or the exportation of specie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
that which you produce in this way will speedily
be withdrawn from the circulation like the rest. It
is only by securing public opinion, and by furnishing
irresistible motives of confidence, that credit
can be ensured; and those who fear that, even
after the restoration of order, the specie which
seems to have vanished from among us will not
re-appear, are mistaken. Gold and silver are
necessarily transported, like other articles of merchandize,
wherever there exist the will and the
power to pay for them; they are even transported
more readily by reason of the ease with which they
are removed. So long as the nation has a surplus
to dispose of, the gold and silver required will
always be procured; for it must not be forgotten
that, if gold and silver are the purchasing medium
for all other things, all other things are equally the
purchasing medium for those metals. For a nation
which has nothing to give, there can be nothing to
obtain; but those nations which have an immense
surplus, cannot long want anything which may be
purchased, and, least of all, gold and silver.</p>

<p>“Since the position of your finances compels you
to be the debtors of other nations, prove yourselves
to be the best possible debtors; you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
the means to do so. Only show that you know
how to set about it, and you will soon see flowing
into the country the capital of the foreigner, who
only awaits that moment to come and exchange
it for your effects. You will see immense sums
brought to light which are at present yielding
nothing, and which would be gladly exchanged
for productive securities bearing annual interest,
when once it is felt that the payment of that interest
is certain, and that the capital will not be
endangered.”</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Bishop of Autun submitted
to the National Assembly a series of articles having
for their object the establishment of a sinking fund
for the gradual extinction of the public debt, the
means of raising the necessary portions of which
for each succeeding year were to be determined at
the commencement of each session of the legislature.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
